<h2 class="h2herein">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pfirst">I
claim no merit for the following pages, other
than may attach to in­dus­try, appli­ca­tion, the
gift of copying accurately, and the acqui­si­tion of
writer’s cramp. The mechan­i­cal writ­ing is—to
the great joy of the com­pos­i­tors who have
dealt with it—every let­ter mine own; but the
best part of the book has been conveyed from
other sources. In fact the book is, as the old
lady said of the divine tragedy of <i>Hamlet</i>, “full
of quotations.” The hand is the hand of Gubbins,
but the voice is, for the most part, the
voice of the great ones of the past, including
Pliny and Gervase Markham. The matter, or
most of it—I am endeavouring to drive the fact
home—is culled from other sources; and if this
is the most useful and inter­est­ing work ever
pub­lished it is more my for­tune than my fault.</p>

<p>The genial reception of my earlier effort,
<i>Cakes and Ale</i>—which was condemned only by
worshippers of <i>Ala</i>, who were not expected
to applaud—together with the hope
of earning
something towards the purchase of a Bath Chair—have
induced me to issue this little treatise on
liquids, as a companion to my first cloth-bound
book. And innate modesty—I stick to “innate,”
despite the critics—compels me to add
that I think the last is the better work. I will,
however, leave a generous and discriminating
public to decide that question for itself.</p>

<p class="pfirst">I wish to state at the outset that
this little work is not compiled in the interests of the
sot, the toper, and the habitual over-estimator of his
swallowing capacity. That the gifts of the gods, and the
concoctions of more or less vile man, should be used with
moderation, if we wish to really and thoroughly enjoy
them, is a truism which needs no repetition; and although
at the commencement of this work many “frightful <span
class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span> examples” of the evils
of over-indulgence will be found mentioned, nothing but
moderation will be found counselled in my book, from cover
to cover.</p>

<p>In the past, drunkenness was not always
regarded as a vice, and this is evident from much
of the literature of former generations. In the
course of my researches into the alcohol question
I have come across a little book which bears the
shameful and abandoned title of <i>Ebrietatis Encomium,
or the Praise of Drunkenness</i>. And this
book, which conveys such questionably moral
aphorisms as “It is good for one’s health to be
drunk occasionally,” and “The truly happy are
the truly intoxicated,” claims to prove, “most
authentically and most evidently, the necessity
of frequently getting drunk, and that the practice
is most ancient, primitive, and catholic.”</p>

<p>The author commences with what he calls
“a beautiful passage out of <span class="nowrap">Seneca:—</span></p>

<p>“The soul must not be always bent: one
must sometimes allow it a little pleasure.
Socrates was not ashamed to pass the time with
children. Cato enjoyed himself in drinking
plentifully, when his mind had been too much
wearied out in public affairs. Scipio knew very
well how to move that body, so much inured
to wars and triumphs, without breaking it, as
some nowadays do .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;; but as people did in
past times, who would make themselves merry
on their festivals, by leading a dance really
worthy men of those days, whence could ensue
no reproach, when even their very enemies had
seen them dance. One must
allow the mind <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
some recreation: it makes it more gay and
peaceful. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Assiduity of labour begets a
languor and bluntness of the mind: for sleep is
very necessary to refresh us, and yet he that
would do nothing else but sleep night and day
would be a dead man, and no more. There
is a great deal of difference between loosening
a thing, and quite unravelling it. Those who
made laws have instituted holidays, to oblige
people to appear at public rejoicings, in order to
mingle with their cares a necessary temperament. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You must sometimes walk in the open air,
that the mind may exalt itself by seeing the
heavens, and breathing the air at your ease;
sometimes take the air in your chariot, the roads
and the change of the country will re-establish
you in your vigour; or you may eat and drink
a little more plentifully than usual. Sometimes
one must even go as far as to get drunk; not
indeed with an intention to drown ourselves in
wine, but to drown our care. For wine drives
away sorrow and care, and goes and fetches them
up from the bottom of the soul. And as
drunkenness cures some distempers, so, in like
manner, it is a sovereign remedy for our sorrows”
(Seneca <i>de Tranquillitate</i>).</p>

<p>Such sentiments were doubtless popular
enough in Great Britain at the commencement
of the present century—when <i>Ebrietatis Encomium</i>
was published—when three and four
bottle-men slept where they fell, “repugnant to
command”; and malt liquor, small or strong,
was the only known matutinal restorative of
manly vigour. But my own
experience is that <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
the sorrow and care which may be temporarily
driven away by drowning them in the bowl are
apt to return within a very few hours, reinforced
an hundredfold, with their weapons re-sharpened,
their instruments of torture put in thorough
working-order, and with many other devils worse
than themselves. A man, sound in body and
mind, may really enjoy a certain amount of good
liquor without feeling any ill effects next morning;
but woe to him who seeks to drown that
which cannot sink; to crush the worm which
knows not death! The individual has yet to be
born who can flourish, either in body or soul,
on his own immoderation; and but for a chronic
state of thirst in early youth I should not now
be reduced to the compilation of drink statistics
for a living.</p>

<p>But the ancients, in their heathen philosophy—which,
by the way, was once rec­om­mend­ed to
Christians to follow—took no thought for the
morrow. “Carpe diem!” was the head and
front of the programme of the Roman patricians,
who used to cry aloud at their feasts, by way of
grace before <span class="nowrap">meat:—</span></p>

<div class="fsz6">
<span class="smcap">A<b>MICI,</b></span><br />
<span class="smcap">D<b>UM</b></span>
<span class="smcap">V<b>IVIMUS</b></span><br />
<span class="smcap">V<b>IVAMUS!</b></span></div>

<p class="pcontinue">This was probably the
original version of “We
won’t go home till morning,” and was sung, or
shouted, at all bean-feasts and smart supper-parties.
The ancient Egyptians made use of a
very extraordinary, and a very nasty, custom in
their festivals. They shewed to
every guest a <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
skeleton, before the soup was served. This,
according to some historians, was to make the
feasters think on their latter end. But others
assert that this strange figure was brought into
use for a directly opposite reason; that the image
of death was shewn for no other intent than to
excite the guests to pass their lives merrily, and
to employ the few days of its small duration to
the best advantage; as having no other condition
to expect after death than that of this frightful
skeleton.</p>

<p>This was the idea of one Trimalchion, who,
Petronius tells us, thus expressed himself on the
subject: “Alas! alas! wretched that we are!
What a nothing is poor man! We shall be like
this, when Fate shall have snatched us hence.
Let us therefore rejoice, and be merry while we
are here.” The original Latin of this translation
is much stronger, and had better not be given
here. And the same Trimalchion on another
occasion remarked: “Alas! Wine therefore lives
longer than man, let us then sit down and drink
bumpers; life and wine are the same thing.”</p>

<p>The Scythians undoubtedly used to drink out
of vessels fashioned from human skulls, and
probably had the same design in doing so as the
Egyptians had in looking on their nasty skeletons.</p>

<p>In Virgil’s time, his contemporaries—and very
probably the old man himself—drank deep; but
instead of fighting, and breaking things, and
jumping on their wives, and getting locked up,
they brought their own heathen religion into
their debaucheries. In more civilized circles, at
this end of the most civilized
century, the reveller <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
goes out “to see a man,” and sub­se­quent­ly
“shouts for the crowd”; but in Virgil’s time
a man who had a drink was said to be “pouring
forth libations to the gods,” “making sacrifices”—more
especially to Bacchus, the wine deity,
whom nothing under the slaughter of a he-goat
was supposed to propitiate. And the “Billy”
was chosen for the sacrifice, because the tender
shoots of the vine formed his favourite food, in
a land in which there was neither brown paper,
nor wall-plaster, nor salmon-tins, to nibble. And
these sacrifices to the rosy god were “occasions”
(as they say in the City) indeed! I have often
wondered what the ancients did to cure a headache;
and whether a man said to be “possessed
of a devil” was in reality suffering from Alcohol,
“the Devil in solution,” in the shape of <i>delirium
tremens</i> in one of its many and objectionable forms.</p>

<p>In the time of Pliny, drunkenness and
debauchery appear to have been the principal
studies of the nations about whom he had
information. A man was actually <i>rewarded</i> for
getting drunk—tell it not in Vine Street, W.!
The greatest drinker got the most prizes; and
Pliny informs us that whilst the Parthians contended
for the distinction of having the hardest
heads and the longest swallows, they were simply
“not in it” with the Milanese, who had a real
champion in one Novellius Torquatus. This
man, according to history, could have given a
market-porter of the present day, a brewer’s
drayman, or a stockbroker, any amount of start
over the Alcohol course, and “lost” him.</p>

<p>This Novellius won the
championship from all <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
pretenders, and “had gone through all honourable
degrees of dignity in Rome, wherein the greatest
repute he obtained was for drinking in the
presence of Tiberius three gallons of wine at one
draught, and before he drew his breath again;
neither did he rest there, but he so far had
acquired the art of drinking, that although he continued
at it, yet was never known to falter in his
tongue; and were it ne’er so late in the evening
he followed this exercise, yet would be ready again
for it in the morning. Those large draughts also
he drank at one breath, without leaving in the cup
so much as would dash against the pavement.”</p>

<p>Ah! We have nobody up to this form to
talk about nowadays; and if men have improved
in morality they must have deteriorated in
capacity, or the occupation of gaolers and warders
would be gone. And the poor old poet “Spring
Onions,” with even a tenth part of the powers
of endurance and swallow of Novellius Torquatus,
might have escaped even one solitary conviction.</p>

<p>“If the antiquity of a custom,” writes the
author of <i>Ebrietatis Encomium</i>, “makes it always
good and laudable, certainly drunkenness can
never deserve sufficient recommendation. Every
one knows that Noah got drunk after he had
planted the vine. There are some who pretend
to excuse him, that he was not acquainted with
the strength of wine. But to this it may very
well be answered that it is not very probable so
wise a man as Noah should plant a vine without
knowing its nature and property. Besides it is one
thing to know whether he got drunk at all: and
another whether he had an intention
to do so.” <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span></p>

<p>The amount of water previously experienced
by Noah should surely be sufficient to purge him
of the offence of making too free with the fruit
of the vine!</p>

<p>“But,” continues the laudator of ebriety,
“if we give any credit to several learned persons,
Noah was not the first man who got fuddled.
Father Frassen maintains ‘that people fed on
flesh before the Flood, and drank wine.’ There
is no likelihood, according to him, that men
contented themselves with drinking water for
fifteen or sixteen hundred years together. It is
much more credible that they prepared a drink
more nourishing and palatable. These first men
of the world were endued with no less share of
wit than their posterity, and consequently wanted
no industry to invent everything that might
contribute to make them pass their lives agreeably.
Before the Flood men married, and gave
their children in marriage. These people regaled
each other, and made solemn entertainments.
Now who can imagine that they drank at those
festivals nothing but water, and fed only on fruits
and herbs! Noah, therefore, was not the inventor
of the use which we make of the grape; the
most that he did was only to plant new vines.”</p>

<p>Procopius of Gaza, one of the most ancient
and learned interpreters of Scripture, thinks it no
less true that the vine was known in the world
before Noah’s time; but he does not allow that
the use of wine was known before the patriarch,
whom he believes to be the inventor of it. As for
the wine mentioned in the New Testament, we
are now assured
by modern commentators—total <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
abstainers every one—that it was unfermented,
devoid of alcohol, and non-intoxicating. I had
certainly always looked upon the wine which
Timothy was enjoined to take for his “stomach’s
sake,” as some form of brandy.</p>

<p>The Early Christians—like far too many of
the late ditto—were terrible topers. Ecclesiastical
history tells us that in the primitive church it
was customary to appoint solemn feasts on the
festivals of martyrs. This appears by the
harangue of Constantine, and from the works of
St. Gregory Nazianzen, and St. Chrysostom.
Drunkenness was rife at those feasts; and this
excess was looked upon as permissible. This is
shewn by the pathetic complaints of St. Augustine
and St. Cyprian, the former of which holy fathers
thus delivered <span class="nowrap">himself:—</span></p>

<p>“Drunken debauches pass as permitted
amongst us, so that people turn them into solemn
feasts, to honour the memory of the martyrs;
and that not only on those days which are
particularly consecrated to them (which would
be a deplorable abuse to those who look at those
things with other eyes than those of the flesh),
but on every day of the year.”</p>

<p>St. Cyprian, in a treatise attributed to him,
says much the same <span class="nowrap">thing:—</span></p>

<p>“Drunkenness is so common with us in
Africa that it scarce passes for a crime. And do
we not see Christians forcing one another to get
drunk, to celebrate the memory of the martyrs?”</p>

<p>Cardinal du Perron told his contemporaries
“that the Manichæans said that the Catholicks
were people much given to wine,
but that they <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
never drank any,” which sounds paradoxical.
Against this charge St. Augustine only defends
them by recrimination. He answers, “that it
was true, but that they (the Manichæans) drank
the juice of apples, which was more delicious
than all the wines and liquors in the world.”
And so does Tertullian, who said the liquor
press’d from apples was most strong and vinous.
His words are: “Succum ex pomis vinosissimum.”</p>

<p>I trust that in quoting all those things I am
not becoming wearisome, at the very commencement
of my work; the main object being to
show that all the drinking in the world is not
done by the present generation of vipers.</p>

<p>But the Early Christians were excused for
their habits of soaking, by Paulinus, on the
grounds of the “excellence of their intentions”;
which naturally reminds us of the celebrated
excuse of the late Monsieur Thiers, on a much
later occasion. The words of Paulinus are, when
translated and <span class="nowrap">adapted:—</span></p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpp00">I think should ready absolution find;</div>

<div class="dpp00">The Pope he leads a joyous life.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">It appears to be a fact that many
former popes drank hard; and if Petrarch is to be
believed, the long stay made by the court of Rome at
Avignon was on account of the excellence of the French
wines; and that it was merely for that <span class="xxpn"
id="p013">{13}</span> reason that they stayed so long in
Provence, and removed with so much reluctance.</p>

<p>Now for the saints. Although the fact of
his drinking deep has been denied, St. Augustine
appears to have confessed to “a day out”
occasionally, in some such words as these: “Thy
servant has been sometimes crop-sick through
excess of wine. Have mercy on me, that it
may be ever far from me.”</p>

<p>Amongst the bishops one instance must
suffice. “Pontus de Thiard,” as appears
from an old translation of the works of an
eminent Frenchman, “after having repented
of the sins of his youth, came to be bishop of
Chalons-sur-Soane; but, however, he did not
renounce the power of drinking heavily, which
seemed then inseparable from the quality of a
good poet. He had a stomach big enough to
empty the largest cellar; and the best wines of
Burgundy were too gross for the subtility of the
fire which devoured him. Every night, at
going to bed, besides the ordinary doses of the
day, in which he would not suffer the least drop
of water, he used to drink a bottle before he
slept. He enjoyed a strong, robust, and vigorous
health, to the age of fourscore.” Dear old
Pontus!</p>

<p>Of all other mighty men, Alexander the
Great serves to best point the moral of the evils
of intemperance. Wearied of conquering, this
hero gave himself up to debauchery in its worst
and wildest forms. He killed his foster-brother
in a fit of drunkenness, and sub­se­quent­ly, at the
bidding of “lovely Thais,”
queen of the <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
Athenian <i>demi-monde</i>, set fire to, and burnt to
the ground, Persepolis, the wonder of the world.
What an awakening Alec must have had! Not
that he was the first, nor yet the last, man to
make a fool, or rogue, of himself, at the bidding
of the (alleged) gentler sex. Cleopatra corrupted
a few heroes, and as for La
Pompadour&#x2009;<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2015twice.png"
width="265" height="120" alt="――" /> but
those be other stories. Alexander the Great,
who had lost most of his greatness by that time,
died from the effects of chronic alcoholism;
although they didn’t tell me as much as this at
school.</p>

<p>Cambyses was but little removed from a sot.
This prince, having been told by one of his
courtiers that the people thought Cambyses
indulged in too many “drunks” for the good of
the nation, reached for his best bow and his
sharpest arrow, and, the courtier having retired
out of range, shot the courtier’s son through the
heart; after which the prince enquired of the
courtier: “Is this the act of a drunkard?”
which reminds me of a more modern anecdote,
of a Piccadilly roysterer. But some men can
shoot straighter, and ride better, and write more
poetically, when under the influence of the rosy
god; and had this courtier been a man of the
world he would not have touched on the subject
of ebriation to his prince. For ebriates are but
seldom proud of their weaknesses.</p>

<p>Darius, the first King of Persia, commanded that
this epitaph, which is here translated, should be
placed on his tomb: “I could drink much wine
and bear it well.” Philip of Macedon, father of
Alexander the Great, took too
much wine on <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
occasion; to corroborate which fact we have
the exclamation of the good lady whose prayer
for justice he had refused to hear&#x2009;—&#x2009;this is a
quotation beloved of members of Parliament—“I
appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober.”
Dionysius the younger, tyrant of Sicily, frequently
had vine-leaves in his hair for a week at
a time; he drank himself almost blind, and his
courtiers, in order to flatter him, pretended to be
blind too, and neither ate nor drank anything
unless it were handed to them by Dionysius
himself. Tiberius was called Biberius, because
of his excessive attachment to the bowl; and, in
derision, they changed his surname of Nero to
Mero. Bonosus, according to his own historian,
Flavius Vobiscus, was a terrible soaker, and used
to make the ambassadors, who came from foreign
parts, even more drunk than himself, in order
that he might discover their secret instructions.</p>

<p>I cannot glean from the ancient records that
any monarch who reigned over Great Britain
was an habitual drunkard, an absolute and confirmed
sot. But many of them were given to
conviviality, notably Richard of the Lion Heart,
Bluff King Hal&#x2009;—&#x2009;who had gout badly, and
suffered also from obesity and other things—and
the Merry Monarch. A story is told of the
Second Charles, that when dining with the Lord
Mayor, Sir Robert Viner, on one occasion—it
was probably a 9th of November dinner at the
Mansion House—the King noticed that most of
the guests were uncomfortably uproarious, and,
with his suite, rose to leave the banqueting
chamber. Whereupon the
Lord Mayor hastily <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
pursued him, caught hold of his robe, and exclaimed:
“Sire, you shall take t’other bottle.”
The King stopped, and with a graceful smile
repeated a line of the old song, “He that is drunk
is great as a king,” and with this compliment to
his host, he returned, and took “t’other bottle.”</p>

<p>The immortal Pepys describes a Lord Mayor’s
Feast which was given in 1663. It was served
at one o’clock, and a bill of fare was placed,
together with a salt-cellar, in front of every
guest; whilst at the end of each table was a list
of “persons proper” there to be seated. Pepys
was placed at the merchant-strangers’ table,
“where ten good dishes to a mess, with plenty
of wine of all sorts.” Napkins and knives were,
however, only supplied at the Lord Mayor’s table
to him and the Lords of the Privy Council; and
Pepys complains bitterly that he and those who
were seated with him had no napkins nor change
of trenchers, and had to drink out of earthen
pitchers. He, however, took his spoon and fork
away with him, as was customary in those days
with all guests invited to entertainments. But
as each guest brought his own tools, nobody was
the worse for this custom. The dinner, says
Pepys, was provided by the Mayor and two
sheriffs for the time being, and the whole cost
was between £700 and £800.</p>

<p>We are not told what was drunk at the
Mansion House on that occasion, but I have a
list before me of the potables served at the Lord
Mayor’s banquet in 1782—more than a century
later—which seems deserving of mention in this
little <span class="nowrap">work:—</span>

<p>There be several remarkable features in the
above list. I had imagined that a taste for claret
had not been fully acquired by the British ratepayer
until some years later than this; whilst the
virtues of champagne could not have been fully
recognized. Lisbon, I conceive to have been
another sort of port, and this seems to have been
neck-and-cork above all other vintages in popular
favour. The taste for such mawkish stuff as
malmsey must have been at vanishing point;
whilst one is led to ask what, with only such a
minute allowance of sack, did these feasters drink
with their soup? Was the succulency of calipash
and calipee known in those days; and if so, where
was the harmless necessary milk-punch? But
the most remarkable feature of all in the above
catalogue is the meagre allowance of brandy for
the crowd. The parable of the loaves and fishes
would not appear more miraculous than that, in
these later days, a multitude could be filled, after a
big dinner, with <i>four</i> bottles of cognac! And this
despite the fact of whisky having almost entirely
usurped the place of
the other strong-water. <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span></p>

<p>One hundred years ago, to be “drunk as a
lord” was considered the height of human happiness.
And at this period the Church had not
severed its old connection with alcohol. In fact
intemperance was encouraged by our pastors and
masters; and in certain districts of England the
churchwardens, at Whitsuntide, made collections
of malt from the parishioners, and this was
brewed into strong ale, and sold in the churches,
the money so obtained being expended on the
repairs of the sacred edifices; and it was a frequent
and a saddening spectacle to see men who
had drunk not wisely reeling about the aisles.
Until as late as 1827—in which year the license
was withdrawn—a church and a tavern were
covered by the same roof, in the parish of Deepdale,
a village between Derby and Nottingham;
and a door which could be opened at will led
from the altar to the tap-room.</p>

<p>A Romish priest wrote in praise of the bowl
as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Si bene commemini, causae sunt quinque bibendi:</div>
<div class="dpp00">Hospitis adventus; praesens sitis; atque futura;</div>
<div class="dpp00">Aut vini bonitas; aut quaelibet altera causa.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Which
comforting and jovial sentiments were
thus adapted for the use of colleges and private
bars, by Dean Aldrich, D.D., the great master of
logic at <span class="nowrap">Oxford:—</span></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">There are, if I do rightly think,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Five reasons why a man should drink:</div>
<div class="dpp01">Good wine, a friend, or being dry,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Or lest you should be by and
by&#x202f;<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2015twice.png"
width="265" height="120" alt="――" /></div>
<div class="dpp01">Or any other reason why.
 <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span></div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">But after all no nation ever did themselves so
well, in the matter of wines, as the inhabitants of
bad old ancient Rome.</p>

<p>“It was to excess of drinking,” wrote Whyte
Melville, in <i>The Gladiators</i>, “that the gluttons
of that period looked as the especial relief of
every entertainment; since the hope of each
seemed to be that when thoroughly flooded, and
so to speak washed out with wine, he might
begin eating again. The Roman was no
drunkard, like the barbarian, for the sake of that
wild excitement of the brain which is purchased
by intoxication. No, he ate to repletion that he
might drink in gratification. He drank to excess
that he might eat again.”</p>

<p>Further on the same writer remarks:
“Whilst marvelling at the quantity of wine
consumed by the Romans in their entertainments,
we must remember that it was the pure
and unadulterated juice of the grape, that it was
in general freely mixed with water, and that they
imbibed but a very small portion of alcohol, which
is the destructive quality of all stimulants.”</p>

<p>As to the Roman vintages being “in general
freely mixed with water,” I have grave doubts.
I have an idea that Maecenas would have made it
particularly warm for that slave who might have
dared to water his old Falernian; and, take them
altogether, an amusement-loving, and playgoing
public, for whom the legitimate drama took the
form of certain brave men and fair women being
torn and eaten by wild beasts, would hardly have
been content with such drink for babes as
“claret cold.” <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span></p>

<p>Ancient poets were not less backward than
modern votaries of the muses; and it is related
of the poet Philoxenus that he was frequently
heard to express the wish that he had a neck as
long as a crane’s, that he might the longer have
the pleasure of swallowing wine, and of enjoying
its delicious taste. I have heard the same wish
expressed, during much more recent years.</p>

<p>One more old song, translated from a French
<i>chanson à boire</i>, and I take my leave of the awful
habits of the ancients (I trust) for ever. It is
called</p>

<div class="dpoemlft">
<div class="dpoemtitle">THE TIPPLING PHILOSOPHERS.</div>

little “tol-de-rol” at the finish of each verse.]</p>

<h2 class="h2herein">CHAPTER III
<span class="hsmall">DRINKS ANCIENT AND MODERN</span></h2>

<div class="depigraph">
The Whitaker of the period — France without wine — Babylonian
boozers — Beer discovered by the Egyptians — A glass of bitter
for Cleopatra — Brainless Persians — German sots — Turning
the tables — Intemperance in the North — Chinese intoxicants — Nature
of Sack — Mead and morat — Vinous metheglin — Favourite
tipple of the Ancient Britons — Braggonet — Birch-wine — “The

Walter Raleigh — Saragossa wine — Usquebaugh — Clary — Apricock
wine.</div>

<p class="pfirst">Pliny—whose
works contain almost as much
general information as Whitaker’s Almanack—tells
us that the western nations got drunk with
certain liquors made with fruits; and that those
liquors have different names in Gaul and Spain,
though they produce the same effect. Ammianus
Marcellinus reports that “the Gauls having no
wine in their country”—only fancy what a
country France must have been to live in without
champagne and claret, not to mention
burgundy and cider—“though they are very
fond of it, contrive a great many sorts of liquors
which produce the same effect as wine.” The
Scythians, too, had no wine,
but got “for’ard” <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
just the same. One of their philosophers, upon
being asked if they had nobody who played the
flute in Scythia, replied that “they had not so
much as any wine there.” Which seems to hint
to flute-playing being a thirsty trade, even in
those days.</p>

<p>The Babylonians were, according to Herodotus,
habitual over-estimators of their swallowing
capacity, and got merry after inhaling the fumes
of certain herbs which they burned; which sounds
like anything but a comfortable debauch, and
must have choked some of them. Strabo tells all
who care to read him that the Indians drank the
juice of sugar-canes, which we now call rum;
whilst according to Pliny and Athenaeus the
Egyptians fuddled themselves with a drink made
from barley; evidently undeveloped beer. And
it is quite on the cards that Cleopatra occasionally
drew, with her own fair hands, for her beloved
Antony, a glass of “bitter,” with a head on it.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>But the quaintest and most awe-inspiring of
all drinks seems to have been that affected by the
Persians—now decent, sober people enough;
this was a liquor made from boiled poppy-seeds,
and called</p>

<h3><i>Kokemaar</i>.</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">They
drank it scalding hot, in the presence of
many spectators, who may or may not have been
charged for admission.</p></div>

<p>“Before it operates,” wrote a chronicler of the
times, “they quarrel with one another, and give
abusive language, without coming to blows;
afterwards when the drug begins
to have its <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
effect, then they also begin to make peace. One
compliments in a very high degree, another tells
stories, but all are extremely ridiculous both in
their words and actions.” And after mentioning
other liquors which they use, he adds, “It is
difficult to find in Persia a man that is not
addicted to one of these liquors, without which
they think they cannot live but very unpleasantly.”
Anything nastier than hot laudanum as a restorative
I cannot imagine.</p>

<p>It sounds curious to read that France and
Spain were censured by that universal provider of
knowledge, Pliny, for their drunkenness with
beer and ale, “wines not being in that age so
frequent.” What was the world like before the
invention of port wine, I wonder? For in
Pliny’s time Italy exceeded all parts of the world
for her luscious and curious vintages, being responsible
for 195 different sorts of wines.</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Their Names and Kinds innumerable are,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Nor for their Catalogue we need not care;</div>
<div class="dpp00">Which who would know as soon may count the Sands</div>
<div class="dpp00">The <i>Western</i> Winds raise
 on the <i>Libyan</i> Strands.</div>
</div></div>

<p>At a much later date, in the seventeenth
century, Italy still held her own in the matter of
the juice of the grape; and then, as now, their
Chianti and Lachrymae Christi were justly celebrated.
Strange to say at the same period the
Germans, we read, “are much given to drunkenness,
as one of their own countrymen writes of
them; they drink so immodestly and immoderately
at their Banquets that they cannot
pour their beer <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
in fast enough with the ordinary Quaffing Cups,
but drink in large Tankards whole draughts,
none to be left under severe penalties; admiring
him that will drink most, and hating him that
will not pledge them.”</p>

<p>I once, in my salad days, assisted in the
attempt to make a German “foxed.” There
were some half a dozen of us, nice boys all, and
we entertained this Teuton right royally. At
the banquet table the champagne was decanted,
and it was so arranged that our guest should
imbibe at least twice as much as anybody else.
Then we took him around the great city. At four
the next morning the German sat facing me in the
smoking-room of a little social club. Everybody
else had gone home, more or less limp, or had
come to anchor in some police-station. And I
did not feel very well myself. And as the clock
chimed four, and the grey dawn stole in through
the venetians in streaks, that German uprose in
all his majesty—he was six feet five inches and
broad in proportion—smote me hard on the back,
and enquired, in cheerful tones: “Now then!
Vhere can ve go to haf some fun?” We
never “took on” any more of the children of
the Fatherland.</p>

<p>The Russians, Swedes, Danes, and other
Northerners—also during the seventeenth century—we
read, “exceed all the rest, having made the
drinking of Brandy, Aqua Vitae, Hydromel, Beer,
Mum, Meth, and other liquors in great quantities,
so familiar to them that they usually drink our
countrymen to death.”</p>

<p>“The Mahometans,” the same
writer tells us, <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
“which possess a great part of the world, on a
superstitious account forbear the drinking of
much wine; because that a young and beautiful
woman being accosted by two angels, that had
intoxicated themselves with it”—an intoxicated
angel surely takes the cake?—“taking the
advantage of their ebriety, made her escape, and
was for her beauty and wit prefer’d in Heaven,
and the angels severely punished for their folly;
for which reason they are commanded not to
drink wine. Yet many of them, doubting of
the divinity of that relation, do transgress that
command, and liberally drink of the blood of the
grape, which the Christians prepare out of their
own vineyards; palliating their crime, in that
they did not plant the tree, nor make the wine.”
For the philosophy of the Mahomedan is like the
ways of the Heathen Chinee, “peculiar.”</p>

<p>“The Chineses,” we are further told, “are
the least addicted to ebriety, delighting themselves
in Coffee, Tea, and such like drinks, free
from those stupifying qualities; yet are they not
without their carouses; and those of the intoxicating
drinks prepared of Rice, Coco’s, Sugar,
Dates, etc., equalling in strength and spirit any
liquors in the world.”</p>

<p>With the “Chineses” must be of course included
the gallant little Japaneses, with which
nation English chroniclers had but a slight acquaintance
three hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Without enquiring too closely into the nature
of Red Falernian, Coan, Massic, or any of the
Roman vintages at the time of dear old Horatius
Flaccus, let us take a glance
over the wine-lists <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
of our own country, from the Saxon period.
And the first thing which will naturally strike
the observer is the heavy, loaded nature of their
dinner drinks. A little later on, Sack did duty
for the “inferior sherry” of the Victorian era,
although a Sack-and-Angostura was not a frequent
demand amongst the young bloods of the period.
On the festive boards of the Saxons appeared,
besides ale of the strongest and cider of the
roughest, home-made wines, mead, morat, metheglin,
and more or less odoriferous pigments. In
case any enterprising ratepayer should elect to
give his guests</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Mead</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">at
his next house-warming, here is the ancient
recipe.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Take of spring-water what quantity you please,
and make it more than blood-warm, and dissolve
honey in it till ’tis strong enough to bear an egg,
the breadth of a shilling; then boil it gently near
an hour, taking of the scum as it rises; then put to
about nine or ten gallons seven or eight large blades
of mace, three nutmegs quartered, twenty cloves,
three or four sticks of cinnamon, two or three roots
of ginger, and a quarter of an ounce of Jamaica
pepper; put these spices into the kettle to the
honey and water, a whole lemon, with a sprig of
sweet-briar and a sprig of rosemary; tie the briar
and rosemary together, and when they have boiled
a little while take them out and throw them away;
but let your liquor stand on the spice in a clean
earthen pot till the next day; then strain it into a
vessel that is fit for it; put the spice in a bag, and
hang it in the vessel, stop it, and
at three months <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
draw it into bottles. Be sure that ’tis fine when
’tis bottled; after ’tis bottled six weeks ’tis fit to
drink.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fancy drinking Mead with your soup!</p>

<p>Morat was made of honey flavoured with
mulberry juice; and Pigment—which might be
drunk at the Royal Academy banquets—was a
sweet and rich liquor evolved from highly-spiced
wine flavoured with honey.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Metheglin</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">was also called Hydromel and Oinomel. “The
best Receipt whereof,” writes an authority, “that
I have observed to be made by them is
<span class="nowrap">thus:—</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>They take rasberries which grow in those parts
(<i>i.e.</i> Swedeland, Muscovia, Russia, and as far as the
Caspian Sea) and put them into fair water for two
or three nights (I suppose they bruise them first)
that the water may extract their taste and colour.
Into this water they put of the purest honey, in
proportion about one pound of honey to three or
four of water. Then to give it a fermentation they
put a tost into it dipp’d in the dregs or grounds of
beer, which when it hath set the metheglin at work
they take out again, to prevent any ill savour it may
give; if they desire to ferment it long they set it in
a warm place; which when they please to hinder or
stop, they remove it into a cool place; after it hath
done fermenting they draw it off the lee for present
use; to add to its excellency they hang in it a little
bagg, wherein is cinnamon, grains of paradise, and a
few cloves. This may do very well for present
drinking. But if you would make your metheglin
of the same ingredients, and to
be kept (time <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
meliorating any sort of drinks) you may preserve your
juice of rasberries at the proper season. And when
you make your metheglin, decoct your honey and
water together, and when it is cold then add your
juice of rasberries which was before prepared to
keep, and purifie your metheglin by the means before
prescrib’d, or ferment it, either by a tost dipp’d in
yest, or by putting a spoonful of yest unto it, to
which you may add the little bagg of spices before
mention’d. Then let it stand about a month to be
thorowly purified, and then bottle it, and preserve
it for use, and it may in time become a curious
drink.”</p></blockquote>

<p>I should think so.</p>

<p>This is what Howell (Clerk to the Privy
Council in 1640) wrote about <span class="nowrap">metheglin:—</span></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">The juice of Bees, not Bacchus, here behold,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Which British Bards were wont to quaff of old;</div>
<div class="dpp01">The berries of the grape with Furies swell,</div>
<div class="dpp01">But in the honeycomb the Graces dwell.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Neither Sir John Barleycorn or Bacchus had
anything to do with it, but it is the pure juice of
the bee, the laborious bee, and the king of insects;
the Druids and old British Bards were wont to
take a carouse hereof before they entered into
their speculations. But this drink always carried
a kind of state with it, for it must be attended
with a brown toast; nor will it admit but of one
good draught, and that in the morning; if more
it will keep a humming in the head, and so
speak too much of the house it comes from, I
mean the hive.”</p>

<p>M’yes. I question the advisability
of any sort <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
of carouse before entering into speculations; more
especially if Tattersall’s Ring be the scene of
your speculations, and you intend getting back
your losses.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that metheglin was the
favourite drink of the Ancient Britons.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Mead and Braggon, or Braggonet</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">do not differ materially from metheglin. Here
is the <span class="nowrap">recipe:—</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Mix the whites of six eggs with twelve gallons of
spring-water; add twenty pounds of the best virgin
honey and the peeling of three lemons; boil it an
hour, and then put into it some rosemary, cloves,
mace, and ginger; when quite cold add a spoonful
or two of yeast, tun it, and when it has done working
stop it up close. In a few months bottle it off, and
deposit in a cool cellar.</p></blockquote>

<p>If this liquor is properly kept, the taste of the
honey will go off; and it will resemble Tokay
both in strength and flavour. And the chief
objection to this as to other ancient potations,
appears to be the intolerable quantity of water,
whether “spring” or “fair.”</p>

<p>We do not make Birch wine nowadays,
although the Birch itself frequently makes small
boys whine, after conviction of orchard-robbing,
or train-wrecking. But it was a favourite tipple
with our ancestors, who during the month of
March were wont to cut the ends off the birch-boughs,
and let the sap drip into bottles suspended
from the boughs. For twopence or threepence
a gallon the villagers would catch
this sap for <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
their wealthier neighbours, regardless of the
feelings, and the cartridges, of the owners of the
trees. To every gallon of liquor was added a
pound of refined sugar, the mixture being boiled
for half an hour or so, then set to cool, with a
little yeast added thereto, to make it ferment.
The result was then put in barrels, together with
a small proportion of powdered mace and
cinnamon. A month afterwards it was bottled
off, and when drunk was said to be “a most
delicate, brisk wine, of a flavour like unto
Rhenish.”</p>

<p>“The Vertues of the Liquor or Blood of the
Birch-tree,” says the historian, “have not long
been discovered, we being beholding to the
Learned Van Helmont for it; who in his <i>Treatise
of the Disease of the Stone</i> hath very much
applauded its Vertues against the effects of the
Disease, calling the natural Liquor that flows from
the wounded Branches of the Tree, the meer
Balsom of the Disease. Ale brewed therewith,
as well as the Wine that is made of it, wonderfully
operates on the Disease. It is also reputed
to be a powerful Curer of the Ptisick.”</p>

<p>All the same you will hardly get the <i>alumni</i>
of Eton and Harrow to love their birch.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>“What was</p>

<h3><i>Sack</i>?”</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">is a question which has often been
asked. It was a common name for a drink in the time of
Shakespeare, and Falstaff had a terrible reputation as a
sackster. The exact nature of the wine is uncertain, but
the name is supposed to be derived <span class="xxpn"
id="p032">{32}</span> from the Spanish <i>seco</i>, and the
French <i>sec</i>, “dry.” Canary (a sort of white Madeira) was
often the wine meant; and in old churchwarden’s accounts
the word sack frequently occurs, as used as a communion
wine, <i>i.e.</i> Madeira and port mixed. That sack was imported
from Spain is certain, and it was first of all sold, in
England, in apothecaries’ shops, as a cordial medicine. The
Excise authorities of the time, if there were any, were in
all probability not quite as busy as at the present day.</p></div>

<p>The name Canary was formerly applied to
dry, white wines, which were frequently seasoned
with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted apples,
and eggs.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Sack Posset</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<div>[Sir Walter Raleigh’s Recipe.]</div>
<p>Boil together half a pint of sherry and half a pint
of ale, and add gradually a quart of boiling cream or
milk. Sweeten the mixture well, and flavour with
grated nutmeg. Put into a heated dish, cover, and
stand by the fire for two or three hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you can see the double ox-fences in
Northamp­ton­shire next morning, there is not
much the mat­ter with your liver.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Here is the method of manufacturing</p>

<h3><i>English Sack</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">which must be a poor, ill-favoured sort of drink.
It was also known as Saragossa wine.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>To every quart of water put a sprig of rue, and
to every gallon a handful of
fennel-roots, boil these <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
half an hour, then strain it out, and to every gallon
of this liquor—ugh—put three pounds of honey;
boil it two hours, and scum it well, and when ’tis
cold pour it off and tun it into a vessel, or such
cask as is fit for it; keep it a year in the vessel, and
then bottle it. ’Tis a very good sack.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the butler who would place this on my
table would get a good sack, too. Mustard-and-water
is cheaper and swifter.</p>

<p>Canary and Rhenish were also drunk freely
during the Elizabethan period—the English
Sack recipe belongs to the Charles I. period—and
long before that usquebaugh, or whisky in
all its original sin, was in demand, although the
Highlanders were no dabs at distillation until the
sixteenth century. Usquebaugh, by the way, is
derived from the old Gaelic <i>Uisge-beatha</i>,
“Water of Life,” and under this name both Irish
and Scotch whisky were originally known.</p>

<p>But this simple water of life was not tasty
enough for some palates, therefore vile men
invented a special blend for the benefit of the
wealthy, and those who had not much work to
do next morning.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>To make Usquebaugh.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>To three gallons of brandy put four ounces of
aniseeds bruised; the next day distil it in a cold
still pasted up; then scrape four ounces of licorice,
and pound it in a mortar, dry it in an iron pan,
do not burn it, put it in the bottle to your distill’d
water, and let it stand ten days. Then take out
the licorice, and to every six quarts
of the spirits <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
put in cloves, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger,
of each a quarter of an ounce, dates stoned and
sliced four ounces; raisins stoned half a pound.
Let these infuse ten days, then strain it out, and
tincture it with saffron, and bottle it and cork it
well.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>It seems just the sort for Jubilee rejoicings
and vestry meetings; but do not give it to the
constable on fixed point duty.</p>

<p>In my pitiable ignorance, I once thought that
Clary was the old English name for Claret. Not
a bit of it. This is how the artistic used to
make</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Clary Wine</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take twenty-four pounds of Malaga raisins, pick
and chop them very small, put them in a tub, and
to each pound a quart of water; let them steep ten
or eleven days—this sounds like a school treat—stirring
it twice every day; you must keep it covered
close all the while; then strain it off, and put it
into a vessel, and about half a peck of the tops of
clary (what was clary?) when ’tis in blossom; stop
it close for six weeks, and then bottle it off; in two
or three months ’tis fit to drink.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Clary naturally leads to</p>

<h3><i>Apricock Wine</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">which we of the nineteenth century miscall
apricot. The derivation of the word is Latin.
Then the Arabs got hold of it, and it became
Al-precoc. Then the thriving Spaniards got hold
of the word, which became Alborcoque; and so
to England. But
to the wine. <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Take three pounds of sugar, and three quarts of
water, let them boil together, and scum it well; then
put in six pounds of apricocks, pared and stoned, and
let them boil till they are tender; then take them up,
and when the liquor is cold bottle it up. You may,
if you please, after you have taken out the apricocks,
let the liquor have one boil with a sprig of flower’d
clary in it.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, you may if you please—and you
probably <i>will</i> please—add a little old brandy to
the decoction.</p>

Indifference of the Chineses — A nasty potion — A nastier — White

<p class="pfirst">“The Chineses,”
says a very old work on liquid
nourish­ment, “make ex­cel­lent Drink of Rice,
which is very pleasant of taste, and is pre­ferred
by them before wine.”</p>

<p>But, like the Germans, the Chineses will eat and
drink pretty nearly anything. And this is the cheering
mixture which the Chineses sampled in the new German
colony of Kiant-schan, according to the <i>Frankfurter</i> <span
class="nowrap"><i>Zeitung</i>:—</span></p>

<p>“Sitting under the poplars one can imagine
oneself in the courtyard of an old German feudal
castle. The hamper is opened, and the cold
mountain stream flowing before the temple serves
as an ice cellar. Once more the male population
of the village puts in
an appearance, standing <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
round the table in amazement at all the unheard-of
things happening. The greatest success attends
the uncorking of the Apollinaris bottles. The
bottle is pointed at the onlookers, and the cork
having been loosened it flies into their faces with
a loud report. At first they are greatly alarmed,
then they enjoy the joke hugely, and at last they
all squat on the ground in a circle, and send a
deputy to the table of the foreigners, bearing a
teacup. The petition is granted, and in the
teacup an exquisite brew is prepared. The
drainings of all the beer bottles are collected, to
which is added a little claret and a liberal proportion
of Apollinaris, and then, in order to lend
greater consistency to the beverage, some sausage
skins are mixed with it. The teacup circulates
amongst the Chinese, and each sips it with reverential
awe. Some of them make fearful grimaces,
but not one has the courage of his opinion, and
it is evident that, on the whole, the drink is
voted a good one, although, perhaps, its flavour
is somewhat rare.”</p>

<p>Next, please. Oh, here is another, about
some neighbours of the Chineses.</p>

<p>“In the Isle Formosa, not far from China,
the Natives make a Drink as strong and intoxicative
as Sack, out of Rice, which they soak in
warm water, and then beat it to a paste in a
Mortar; then they chew some Rice-meal in their
mouths, which they spit to a pot till they have
got about a quart of liquor, which they put to
the paste instead of Leaven or Ferment. And
after all be kneaded together till it be Dough,
they put it into a great earthen
pot, which they <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
fill up with water, and so let it remain for two
months; by which means they make one of the
most pleasant Liquors a man need drink; the
older the better and sweeter, although you keep
it five and twenty or thirty years.”</p>

<p>Weel—I hae ma doots.</p>

<p>Until reading “<i>The English Housewife</i>, containing
the inward and outward Vertues which
ought to be in a complete Woman, published by
Nicholas Okes at the sign of the golden Unicorne,
in 1631,” I had no skill in making</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>White Bastard</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">or
“aparelling” Muskadine. They used a lot of
eggs in the vintry in those days, and these were
the instructions for making white bastard.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Draw out of a pipe of bastard ten gallans, and
put to it five gallans of new milke, and skim it as
before, and all to beat it with a parill of eight whites
of egges, and a handfull of Baysalt and a pint of
conduit-water, and it will be white and fine in the
morning. But if you will make very fine bastard—which
I, personally, have no ambition to do—take
a white-wine hog’s-head, and put out the lees, and
wash it cleane, and fill it halfe full and halfe a quarter,
and put to it foure gallans of new milke, and beate it
well with the whites of sixe egges, and fill it up with
white-wine and sacke, and it will be white and fine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bastard had not much rest in the seventeenth
century. The housewife who might wish “to
helpe bastard being eager” had to follow these
<span class="nowrap">directions:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take two gallons of the best
stoned honey, and <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
two gallons of white wine, and boyle them in a
faire panne, skimme it cleane, and straine it through
a faire cloth that there be no moats in it; then put
to it one ounce of collianders (coriander seeds?) and
one ounce of aniseeds, foure or five orange pils (pips?)
dry and beaten to powder, let them lye three dayes;
then draw your bastard into a cleane pipe, then put
in your honey with the rest, and beate it well; then
let it lye a weeke and touch it not, after draw it at
pleasure.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the present enlightened century such a
recipe does not read like helping the possible
consumer to be “eager.”</p>

<p>Nor does the following method of treating
Malmsey sound promising, except for making its
consumer particularly <span class="nowrap">“for’ard”:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you have a good but of Malmsey, and a but or
two of sacke that will not be drunke; for the sacke
prepare some empty but or pipe, and draw it more
than halfe full of sacke; then fill it up with Malmsey,
and when your but is full within a little, put into it
three gallons of Spanish cute, the best that you can
get—where did they get it?—then beate it well;
then take your taster, and see that it bee deepe
coloured; then fill it up with sacke, and give it
aparell, and beate it well. The aparell is thus:
Take the yelkes of tenne egges and beate them in a
cleane bason with a handful of Bay salt, and a
quarte of conduit-water, and beate them together
with a little peece of birch, and beate it till it be as
short as mosse; then draw five or sixe gallons out of
your but, then beate it againe, and then fill it up,
and the next day it will be ready to be drawne.
This aparell will serve both for muscadine, bastard,
and for sacke. <span class="xxpn"
id="p040">{40}</span></p></blockquote>

<p>We are not told in history if the butt of
Malmsey in which the Duke of Clarence shuffled
off his mortal and sinful coil had been previously
subjected to this “aparell” and castigation. In
the interests of mercy, let us hope not.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>The fluid once known as</p>

<h3><i>Mum</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">never claimed any sort of relationship with
sparkling wine, but was a species of unsophisticated
ale, brewed from wheat, or oats, with a
little bean-meal occasionally introduced; in fact,
the sort of stuff we use in the present century to
fatten bacon pigs upon. And “mum” has <i>not</i> been
the word with British brewers for some time past.</p></div>

<p>Champagne has been made in England for a
considerable period; but since the closing of the
“night-houses” in Panton Street the trade
therein has not been very brisk. During the
present century champagne in this country—and
I grieve to add in France as well—has been
chiefly fabricated from apples, and other fruits;
but here is a much older way of making</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>English Champagne</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take to three gallons of water nine pounds of
Lisbon sugar; boil the water and sugar half an hour,
scum it clean, then have one gallon of currants
pick’d, but not bruis’d, pour the liquor boiling hot
over them, and when cold work it with half a pint
of balm two days; then pour it through a flannel
or sieve, then put it into a barrel fit for it with half
an ounce of ising-glass well bruis’d. When it has
done working stop it close for a
month, then bottle <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
it, and in every bottle put a very small lump of
double-refin’d sugar. This is excellent wine, and
has a beautiful colour.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>“Life without Ebulum,” writes a friend, an
instructor of youth in the ingenuous arts, in
forwarding me the recipe, “is a void to most
people who have not cultivated the eringo root
in their back gardens.” I have never tasted
ebulum, preferring my ale neat and unadorned,
but this is how to prepare</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Ebulum</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>To a hogshead of strong ale take a heap’d bushel
of elderberries, and half a pound of juniper berries
beaten; put in all the berries when you put in the
hops, and let them boil together till the berries
break in pieces; then work it up as you do ale.
When it has done working, add to it half a pound
of ginger, half an ounce of cloves, as much mace,
an ounce of nutmegs, and as much cinnamon grosly
beaten, half a pound of citron, as much eringo root,
and likewise of candied orange-peel. Let the sweetmeats
be cut in pieces very thin, and put with the
spice into a bag, and hang it in the vessel when you
stop it up. So let it stand till ’tis fine, then bottle
it up, and drink it with lumps of double-refin’d
sugar in the glass.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>One of the quaintest beverages of which I ever heard, or
read, is</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Cock Ale</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to make this, the <i>Compleat Housewyfe</i>
instructs us to take ten gallons of ale, and a large <span
class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span> cock, the older the
better. Parboil the cock, flea (flay?) him, and stamp him
in a stone mortar till his bones are broken (you must craw
and gut him when you flea him), then put the cock into two
quarts of sack, and put to it three pounds of raisins of
the sun stoned, some blades of mace, and a few cloves; put
all these into a canvas bag, and a little before you find
the ale has done working, put the ale and bag together into
a vessel; in a week or nine days bottle it up, fill the
bottles but just above the neck, and give it the same time
to ripen as other ale.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>I have frequently read of the giving of “body” to ale and stout, by
means of the introduction of horseflesh; and an old song used to tell
us that upon one of the paupers in a certain workhouse happening,
in­ad­ver­tently, to fall head-fore­most into the copper,</p>

<div class="fsz6">dreadful to tell, he was boiled in the soup,</div>

<p class="pcontinue">which,
on that account, in all probability so strengthened the
con­sti­tu­tions of the other paupers as to render them impatient of
work­house dis­ci­pline. The man who disap­peared mysteriously—this is Mr.
Samuel Weller’s story—and who unwittingly furnished “body” for the
sausages supplied to the neigh­bour­hood, was, after all, benefiting his
fellow-men. But to put the rooster into the ale-cask smacks somewhat of
barbarism; and thank goodness we do not work off our surplus poultry in
that fashion nowadays. But these barbarians were not ashamed; for lo!
facing me is “another way” for the man­u­fac­ture of rooster-beer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take an old red, or other cock, and boyle him <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span> indifferent well;
then flea his skin clean off, and beat him flesh and bones in a stone
mortar all to mash, then slice into him half a pound of dates, two
nutmegs quartered, two or three blaids of mace, four cloves; and put
to all this two quarts of sack that is very good; stop all this up
very close that no air may get to it for the space of sixteen hours;
then tun eight gallons of strong ale into your barrel so timely as
it may have done working at the sixteen hours’ end; and then put
thereinto your infusion and stop it close for five days, then bottle
it in stone bottles; be sure your corks are very good, and tye them
with pack-thread; and about a fortnight or three weeks after you may
begin to drink of it; you must also put into your infusion two pound
of raisins of the sun stoned.</p></blockquote>

<p>Holy <span class="sprghta">Moses&#x202f;!</span> What a
drink&#x202f;!</p>

<p>“It is necessary,” wrote a chronicler of the
day, “that our English Housewife be skilfull in
the election, preservation, and curing of all sorts
of wines, because they be usuall charges under
her hands, and by the least neglect must turne
the Husband to much losse.”</p>

<p>This was written, I may interpolate, before
the bicycle craze had set in, and before the era
of ladies’ clubs. Fancy asking the New Woman
to elect, preserve, and cure all sorts of wines!</p>

<p>“Therefore,” continues the same writer, “to
speak first of the election of sweete Wines she
must be careful that her Malmseys be full Wines,
pleasant, well hewed, and fine; that Bastard be
fat, and if it be tawny it skils not, for the tawny
Bastards be always the sweetest. Muskadine
must be great, pleasant, and strong,
with a swete <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
sent, and Amber colour. Sacke, if it be Seres
(Xerez?), which it should be, you shall know it
by the marke of a corke burned on one side of

close stop’t three days, and then squeeze six more, and
mix with two quarts of spring-water, and as much sugar as
will sweeten the whole, and boil the water and lemons and
sugar together, and let it stand till ’tis cool. Then add
a quart of white wine and the other lemon and brandy, and
mix them together, and run it through a flannel bag into

This potion reads well, and I

in three waters, and save three pints of the last

<p>In the matter of possets—of which more

the directions for making</p>

<h3><i>King William’s Posset</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take a quart of cream, and mix with it a pint of
ale, then beat the yolks of ten eggs and the whites
of four; when they are well beaten,

<h3><i>To make the Pope’s Posset.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Blanch and beat three-quarters of a pound of
almonds so fine that they will spread between your
fingers like butter, put in water as you beat them

sugar, make it boiling hot, and at the same
time put half a pint of water to your almonds, and
make them boil; then take both off the fire, and

white sugar, and six pounds of raisins of the sun cut
small; boil them together one hour; then take of
the flowers of elder, when they are falling and will
shake off, the quantity of half a peck; put them in
the liquor when ’tis almost cold, and next day put in
six spoonfuls of syrup of lemons, and four spoonfuls of
ale yeast; and two days after put it into a vessel
that is fit for it, and when it has stood two months

<p>“The Elstertune,” says my informant, “are
best, you shall know it by the Fat, for it is double
bard and double pinned”—I have not the faintest
idea what he means, but those are his words;
“the Barabant is nothing so good, and there is
not so much good to be done with them as with
the other. If the Wines be good and pleasant, a
man may rid away a Hogshead or two of White
wine, and this is the most vantage a man can
have by them; and if it be slender and hard,
then take three or four gallons of stone-honey
and clarify it cleane; then put into the honey
four or five gallons of the same wine, and then
let it seeth a great while, and put into it twopence
in cloves bruised, let them seeth together,
for it will take away the sent of honey; and
when it is sodden take it off, and set it by till it
be thorow cold; then take foure gallons of milke
and order it as before, and then put all into your
wine, and all to beate it; and (if you can) role it,
for that is the best way; then stop it close and
let it lie, and that will make it pleasant.”</p>

<p>Possibly, but it seems a deal of trouble to
take over a wine.</p>

<p class="pfirst">As
much poetry has been written in praise of
John Bar­ley­corn as in praise of wine, woman,
battles, heroes, Cupid’s darts, and patent med­i­cines.
And one dear old song, which seems to
ring in my ears as I write, proclaimed that in
the opinion of the author the nectar which the
gods imbibed from golden goblets on the top of
Mount Olympus was in reality cool, re­fresh­ing
pale ale, quaffed out of pewter tankards.
Whether this was so matters not, but as to
the antiquity of beer as a beverage there can be
no question; and however much the demand
for other liquors may have slackened during the
rolling on of time, John Barleycorn is still growing
in public estimation.
Breweries keep on <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
springing up all over the country, and those who
purchase shares in them receive, for the most
part, sub­stan­tial div­i­dends. “Beer and the
Bible” have won more elections than any other
combination; the organ­i­za­tion of the brewers
has hitherto proved powerful enough to withstand
all the slings and arrows of the Prohibition party,
whilst there has been an enormous increase in
the value of houses licensed to sell fermented
refreshment; and the name of Bass will “live
on,” like Claudian, “through the centuries.”</p>

<p>There be more than one description of beer
put before the public. I forget at this moment
who was responsible for the “swipes” of my
school days, which tasted like red ink—and I have
sampled both—but I have always believed that
the man­u­fac­turer—I do not believe him to have
been a brewer at all—had a special spite against
the rising generation, which he wished to die a
lingering death. The “ninepenny” quaffed
beneath the holy shade of Henry was good,
sound, wholesome tipple; but I fancy an inferior
brand was poured forth to us at “half time” in
the football field. Since those days I have tasted
pretty nearly all sorts and conditions of beer,
from the “Number One” Bass drawn from the
wood in pewter pots, in a little hostelry just off
the Waterloo Road—the very best according to
my taste—to the awful stuff tasted, and only
tasted, one Sunday in a charmingly rural-looking
little inn, with a thatched roof—a licensed house
which apparently laid itself out to entrap the
daring and enterprising “<i>bona fide</i> traveller,” and
whose malt liquor was
apparently composed for <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
the most part of vinegar and dirty water, in
which had been soaked quassia chips, salt, bloater-heads,
and some of the thatch from the roof.</p>

<p>Beer was the current name in England for
every description of malt liquor before the
introduction of “the wicked weed called hops”
from the Netherlands in 1524. According to
the <i>Alvismal</i>, a didactic Scandinavian poem of
the tenth century, this malt liquor was called ale
amongst men, and beer by the gods; and it was
probably from this Scandinavian poem that the
author of the anything-but-didactic poem quoted
above got his ideas as to the real nature of the
beverage partaken of on Olympus. In the
Eastern counties of England, and over the greater
part of the kingdom, ale signifies strong, and beer
small, malt liquor, but in the West these names
mean exactly the reverse—which must be confusing
in the extreme to the intelligent foreigner
on his travels in search of facts and—refreshment.
As now used, ale is distinguished from beer—I
am alluding to the more civilized parts of our
country—chiefly by its strength, and by the
quantity of sugar remaining in it undecomposed.
Strong ale is made from the best pale malt, and
the fermentation is allowed to proceed slowly,
and the ferment to be exhausted and separated.
This, together with the large quantity of sugar
still left undecomposed, enables the liquor to
keep long, without requiring a large amount of
hops.</p>

<p>The last few lines may give the reader the
impression that the writer served his time in
Burton-on-Trent; but this is not
the case. I <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
have conveyed the bulk of my technical knowledge
of brewing from standard works on the
subject.</p>

<p>It will be gathered from some previous
remarks that all is not beer that’s bitter; and
although it would seem impossible to find a
cleaner, healthier, or more strengthening drink
than the “pure beer” of commerce, brewed from
good English or Scotch barley, Kentish hops,
and fair spring-water, how about the wash sold
in some licensed houses which is “fetched up”
with foot-sugar, bittered with quassia, and mixed
with salt and any nasty flavourer which is
handy?</p>

<p>The old stories about the carcass of a horse
placed in the London stout, to give it “body,” and
the mysterious disappearance of an Italian organ-grinder,
together with his monkey and infernal
machine, just outside a high-class brewery, are
probably apocryphal. And although the ancients
undoubtedly put a red cock—the older the better—into
ale, on occasion, the nineteenth century
Briton, for the most part, if the rooster be too
tough to serve as a boiled <i>bonne bouche</i> with
parsley-and-butter, usually makes Cock-a-Leekie
of him. And thereby hangs a tale.</p>

<p>When my firm was running a small chicken-ranche
we once reared an unfortunate fowl, who
had curvature of the spine, almost from the
fracture of his shell. He was a weakling, and
his brethren and sistren, after the manner of
birds, beasts, and fishes, who “go for” the
anæmic and infirm, persecuted him exceedingly,
and peeked most of his feathers
off. Being a <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
merciful, and withal a thrifty, poultry-farmer, I
looked out an old parrot’s cage from the tool-shed,
and in this cage installed the weakly cockerel.
He was forthwith christened “Poor Richard,”
and given little Benjamin’s share of the corn and
wine, and cayenne pepper and—other things.
And although his head was still slewed round to
starboard, he thrived under his liberal nourishment
and freedom from the assaults of his relatives.</p>

<p>Time flew on. I had been the “Northern
Circuit,” in the pursuit of my then profession of
reporter of the sport of kings. I returned home
late on a Saturday night, and next day we had
friends to dinner. So much North Country
language, and so much travelling about had quite
put our feathered and afflicted pensioner out of
my head; and even the fact of our having the
favourite broth of His Majesty King James the
First for dinner did not suggest anything to my
busy brain. But afterwards, when we were
alone—she ought not to have done it—my life-partner
confided to me that I had helped to eat
“Poor Richard”! And I felt like a very
cannibal; and mourned the bird as a brother.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>But to return. In Queen Elizabeth’s reign
it was, I used to believe, a capital offence to put
hops into beer. But these are the directions for</p>

<h3><i>Brewing of Strong Ale</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">issued by one Gervase Markham,
an authority on the subject, and a contemporary of
Shakespeare; and in these directions “hops” are distinctly
mentioned as one of the component parts of the brew. <span
class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Now for the brewing of strong Ale, because it is
drinke of no such long lasting as Beere is, therefore
you shall brew lesse quantity at a time thereof, as two
bushels of Northerne measure (which is foure bushels
or halfe a quarter in the South) at a brewing, and not
above, which will make foureteene gallons of the
best Ale. Now for the mashing and ordering of it
in the mash-fat, it will not differ any thing from that
of Beere; as for hops, although some use not to put
in any, yet the best Brewers thereof will allow to
foureteene gallons of Ale a good espen full of hops,
and no more, yet before you put in your hops, as
soone as you take it from the graines, you shall put
it into a vessell, and change it, or blinke it in this
manner: Put into the Wort a handfull of Oke-bowes
and a pewter dish, and let them lye therein
till the Wort looke a little paler than it did at the
first, and then presently take out the dish and the
leafe, and then boile it a full houre with the hops,
as aforesayd, and then clense it, and set it in vessels
to cook; when it is milk-warme, having set your
Barme to rise with some sweete Wort; then put all
into the guilfat, and as soone as it riseth, with a dishe
or bowle beate it in, and so keepe it with continuall
beating a day and a night, and after run it. From
this Ale you may also draw halfe so much very good
middle Ale, and a third part very good small Ale.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Another way</p>

<h3><i>To make Strong Beer</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">was published at a later date than the above, and
to my thinking is not a better way.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>To a barrel of beer take two bushels of malt and
half a bushel of wheat just crackt in the mill, and
some of the flour lifted out of
it; when your <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
water is scalding hot, put it in your mashing-fat; there
let it stand till you can see your face in it; then
put your malt upon it, then put your wheat upon
that, and do not stir it; let it stand two hours
and a half; then let it run into a tub that
has two pounds of hops in it, and a handful
of rosemary flowers, and when ’tis all run put
it in your copper and boil it two hours; then
strain it off, setting it a-cooling very thin, and set it
a-working very cool; clear it very well before you
put it a-working, put a little yeast to it; when the
yeast begins to fall, put it into your vessel, and when
it has done working in the vessel, put in a pint of
whole wheat and six eggs; then stop it up, let it
stand a year, and then bottle it. Then mash again,
stir the malt very well in, and let it stand two hours,
and let that run, and mash again, and stir it as
before; be sure you cover your mashing-fat well up,
mix the first and second running together; it will
make good household beer.</p></blockquote>

<p>I rather fancy the blend­ing of a lot of eggs
(pre­sum­ably new-laid) with the mash, would
“break” some of the smal­ler brewers. It could
hardly be done at the price.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>The Germans make</p>

<h3><i>Beer Soup.</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">Whether this is made from British or lager
beer is not stated in the recipe before me, which
hardly reads suited to the ordinary English
palate.</p></div>

<p>I will now give a few modern recipes for
tasty beer-compounds. <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span></p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Ale Cup (Cold).</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a round of
hot toast; lay on it a thin piece of the rind, a tablespoonful
of powdered sugar, a little grated nutmeg
or powdered all-spice, and a sprig of balm. Pour
over these one wine-glass of brandy, two of sherry,
and three pints of mild ale. Do not allow the
balm to remain in many minutes.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Ale Flip (Hot).</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Put into a saucepan three pints of ale, a tablespoonful
of sugar, a blade of mace, a clove, and a
small piece of butter, and bring the liquor to a boil.
Beat the white of one egg and the yolks of two
thoroughly, mixing with them a tablespoonful of
cold ale. Mix all together, and then pour the whole
rapidly from one large jug to another, from a good
height—mind your fingers and the furniture—for
some minutes, to froth it thoroughly. Do not allow
it to get cool.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Ale Posset (Hot).</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Boil a pint of new milk, and pour it over a slice
of toasted bread. Stir in the beaten yolk of an egg
and a small piece of butter, and sugar <i>ad lib.</i> Mix
these with a pint of hot ale, and boil for a few
minutes. When the scum rises the mixture is ready
for use.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Mulled Ale (Very Hot).</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Put half a pint of ale, a clove, a little whole
ginger, a piece of butter the size of a marble, and
a teaspoonful of sugar into a
saucepan, and bring <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
it to boiling-point. Beat two eggs with a tablespoonful
of cold ale, and pour the boiling ale into
them, and then into a large jug. Pass the whole from
one jug to another, as in the case of Ale Flip, return
to saucepan, and heat it again till almost, <i>not quite</i>,
at boiling-point.</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>With regard to</p>

<h3><i>Wassail, or Swig (Cold)</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">which used to be a very popular
beverage at the uni­vers­i­ties—at one time it was peculiar
to Jesus College, Oxford—is of very ancient date
indeed.</p></div>

<p>“Sir quod he,” is part of a conversation culled
from an old MS., “Watsayll, for never days of
your lyf ne dronk ye of such a cuppe,” which
sounds as if the Watsayll was of a seductive and
harmful nature. Nev­er­the­less here is the recipe,
taken from “Oxford Nightcaps.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put into a bowl half a pound of Lisbon sugar (if
you do not possess that brand, I have no doubt
“best lump,” pulverized, will do as well), and pour
on it one pint of warm beer; grate a nutmeg and
some ginger into it; add four glasses of sherry and
five additional pints of beer; stir it well and
sweeten to taste; let it stand covered up two or
three hours, then put three or four slices of bread
cut thin and toasted brown into it, and it is fit for
use. Sometimes two or three slices of lemon are
introduced, together with a few lumps of sugar
rubbed on the peel of a lemon. Bottle this mixture,
and in a few days it may be drunk in a state of
effervescence.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the festival of St. David, an immense silver-gilt
bowl, the gift of Sir Watkin
W. Wynne to <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>
the college in 1732 is filled with this “swig,”
and passed round, at Jesus College. And I
should prefer to call the beverage “swig” instead
of “wassail,” which should properly be a <i>hot</i>
drink, if we are to believe the illustrated papers
at Christmas-time. And there is no toast in the
orthodox Wassail, but, instead, roasted apples.

<h3><i>Brown Betty</i></h3>

<p>Here is another old
<span class="nowrap">recipe:—</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Dissolve a quarter of a pound of brown sugar in
one pint of water, slice a lemon into it, let it stand
a quarter of an hour, then add a small quantity of
pulverised cloves and cinnamon, half a pint of
brandy, and one quart of good strong ale; stir it
well together, put a couple of slices of toasted bread
in it, grate some nutmeg and ginger over the toast,
and it is fit for use. Ice it well, and it will prove
a good summer, warm it and it will become a
pleasant winter, beverage. It is drunk chiefly at
dinner.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rather heavily loaded for a dinner drink, I
should say.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Another recipe for</p>

<h3><i>Ale Flip</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">will serve, here.
<span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span></p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Beat well together in a jug, four eggs with a
quarter of a pound of sifted sugar; then add by
degrees, stirring all the time, two quarts of old Burton
ale, and half a pint of gin; pour backwards and forwards
from one jug to another, and when well frothed
serve in tumblers. Grate a little nutmeg atop of each
portion. This is one of the best “nightcaps” I
know—especially after you may have been badger-hunting,
or burgling, or serenading anybody on
Christmas Eve.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Rumfustian.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Beat up in a jug, the yolks of two eggs with a
tablespoonful of sifted sugar; then take half a pint of
old Burton ale, one wine-glass of gin, one wine-glass of
sherry, a little spice and lemon rind. Let the ale, wine,
and gin, mixed together come to the boil, then pour in the
egg mixture, whisking rapidly; serve hot, with a little
nutmeg grated atop.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Such compound drinks, into which ale enters,
as Shandy-gaff require no mention here. Suffice
it to mention that this gaff has for many years
been the favourite beverage of those who go up
the river—there is but one river in England—in
boats, whether schoolboys, or of riper years.
In Stock Exchange circles champagne is occasionally
substituted for ginger-beer, but this is
a combination in which I have no implicit belief;
although champagne and Guinness’s stout make
an excellent mixture. Stout and bitter, otherwise

<p class="pfirst">In
a speech made some years ago Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach observed that nearly one million
sterling’s worth of tobacco was wasted annually
by throwing away cigarette-ends and the stumps
of cigars. But what would you, Sir Michael?
Are the lieges to cremate their lips and singe
their moustaches by smoking on to the (literally)
bitter end? Whether or no, it is tolerably certain
that there is an enormous daily waste in
the matter of in­tox­i­ca­ting drinks—without
counting the wanton, although con­sci­en­tious,
des­truc­tion made by teetotal magnates. According
to statistics—I shall not madden my readers
with many of
these—more than £138,000,000 <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
are spent annually in Great Britain on spirituous
liquors. Half of this sum, it may be fairly stated,
is spent in the provinces. It may also be taken
as read that 5 per cent of beer and stout is
wasted, in the way of froth, spillings, and leavings,
and 3 per cent of spirits. This brings us
face to face with the calculation that the value
of our daily waste in drinks is nearly £6500.
Carbonic acid gas is undoubtedly answerable
for a lot of this waste. In <i>The Old Guard</i>,
a musical piece produced at the Avenue
Theatre some years ago, Mr. Arthur Roberts in
his instructions to Miss Phyllis Broughton—who
made a very comely stage barmaid—particularly
enjoined her, when drawing ale, to use
her left hand to bring the handle down.</p>

<p>“The right hand,” he observed—of course it
was all “gag”—“is for the froth.” And then
he shewed her how to make half a pint of liquor
fill a pint measure. Of course there be some
professional imbibers who would object strongly
and refuse to accept the froth programme; but
on the other hand it pays the retailer, in the long-run.
I am not going to re-tell the old story of
the Quaker; but will only mention that in the
early seventies the landlord of a favourite tavern
in the Strand—a house of call for histrions, which
has since then been transmogrified and adorned
with much bevelled glass and carved walnut—once
confided to me that he made every bit of
£300 per annum out of his froth. His barmaids
were all of angelic appearance, with most beautiful
heads of hair (the girls wore plenty of it in those
days) and a wealth of pretty
prattle. And the <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
customers being susceptible, and liberal-minded,
the rest was easy.</p>

<p>Egyptian manuscripts written at least 3000
years before the Christian era shew conclusively
that even at that primitive period the man­u­fac­ture
of an intoxicating liquor from barley or other
grain was extensively carried out in Egypt.
Probably the wretched Israelites got far more
birch and bastinado than beer given them whilst
engaged in brickmaking; but it is quite on the
cards that Cleopatra, when fatigued with practising
the spot stroke on her billiard-table, often
commanded one of her slaves to draw her a pint
of bitter with a head on it; and who knows but
that her beloved Antony cooled his coppers with
small ale?</p>

<p>Pliny—who would be a useful sort of man to
have in a daily newspaper office nowadays—records
that in his time a fermented drink made
from “corn and water” was in regular use in all
the districts of Europe with which he was acquainted.
But in Britain little was known about
beer before the Roman conquest, as the favourite
beverages of our ancestors were mead and cider.
But the Romans, although they never quite
succeeded in subduing the stubborn dispositions
of the “barbarians,” managed to teach them a
bit of husbandry, and to shew them something
about brewing. There were no means of making
wine in those days, and—save in Wales—there
were no grapes to make it with; but the
Latins were not long in teaching the Britons—who
were never slow to learn anything which
might lead to revelry—that
a very good <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
substitute for wine might be expressed from grain
and water. Hops were undoubtedly known
in England before the conquest, but do not
appear to have been regularly used in brewing
before the be­gin­ning of the sixteenth century.
It is probable, therefore, that they were employed
as medicine—and there is no better tonic than
your hop. The Germans would seem to have
brewed with the “wicked weed” before the
Englanders did, according to the omniscient
Pliny.</p>

<p>The horny-handed son of toil, who can put
away his four or five gallons daily during harvest-time,
without falling off the waggon, may not
know it, but it is only the female hop which is
used by the brewer of to-day. The char­ac­ter­is­tics
of the he-hop are not known to the
writer, or whether he plays any part in aiding
to relieve the thirst of the lieges; but the
female is said to exercise “a purifying, a preservative,
and an aromatic influence over the
wort.”</p>

<p>It used to be a popular fallacy that the beer
made at Burton-on-Trent was brewed from
Trent water, instead of, as was and is the case,
from spring-water, which is eminently suited to
the purpose. The chief industry at Burton was,
originally, cotton-spinning, but fifty years ago
this industry was discontinued owing to the
triumphal march of John Barleycorn. Why
spin cotton when the man­u­fac­ture of beer is not
only a much healthier occupation but is far
more lucrative? So Burton stuck to its beer-making,
a trade which
was originally established <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
there—in a very small way—in the sixteenth
century. There appears to have been a demand
for Burton ale in London, during the reign of
Charles I.; although details are missing as to
whether the demand extended to the royal
palaces. It is certain, however, that more
than one hundred years ago Burton-on-Trent did
a considerable export trade with the Baltic.
In 1791 there were nine breweries here, and in
1851 sixteen. But at the be­gin­ning of the
present century, until the last-named year, when
the great Exhibition attracted all the world and
his wife to England, the breweries at Burton
were not all in a flourishing condition; and I
have more than once heard my grandfather—who
spoke from personal knowledge—tell the story of
how the late Mr. Michael Thomas Bass most
magnanimously offered to “prop up” another
large firm, with the remark, “There’s room
enough for us both here!”</p>

<div class="section">
<p>At present there are thirty breweries in
Burton-on-Trent, and employed in these are
some 8000 men and boys. After the opening of
the Midland Railway in 1839 the brewing trade
here began to improve, but it was mainly due to
the energy and practical knowledge of Mr.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<h3><i>Bass</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">aforementioned that Burton-on-Trent in general,
and the great firm of Bass are in their present
flourishing condition. In the words of Shakespeare,
“He was a man; take him for all in all
we shall not look upon his like again.” Beginning
as traveller to the firm, he was
not long ere <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
he became its chief director. He was untiring
in business, a man possessing the broadest views
of men and things, a bit crotchety on occasion,
but possessed of “that most excellent gift of
charity,” in boundless supplies. Amongst his
other benefactions was the building and endowment
of St. Paul’s, Burton, and the gift of
recreation grounds, a free library, and swimming-baths
to the adjacent town of Derby. He also
built and endowed another church on his own
estate, at Rangemore; and his hand was never
out of his cash-pocket when he could aid in a
good work. He represented Derby, in the
Liberal interest, from 1848 to 1883, and was a
tower of strength to that party, albeit possessed
of nothing like bigoted opinions. On the
contrary, it was his custom through life, like
Hal o’ the Wynd in <i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i>,
to “fight for his own hand.” And as an instance
of his energy and grit, it may be mentioned that
after voting in the House of Commons for Mr.
Gladstone’s Irish Church Disestablishment Bill—the
division on which did not take place till
2
<span class="smmaj">A.M.</span>—he travelled by the “newspaper train”
at 5
<span class="smmaj">A.M.</span> from Euston to Rugeley in order to
hunt with Mr. Hugo Meynell Ingram’s hounds,
later in the morning, changing his clothes on the
way down. The meet was at Brereton Hayes,
close to Cunnock Chase, and I well remember
greeting him that morning, and receiving for a
reply: “Thank you, I’m pretty well for an old
’un.” He was over seventy (I think) at the
time. That was three decades ago; and since
then the trade of Bass
has increased enormously. <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
For the annual holiday of the staff I should be
afraid to state from memory how many special
trains are required to convey the great hive of
workers to Brighton, and other far-distant
watering-places, and back to Burton again. In
short, it would be hard to find a spot in the
inhabited world in which the name of Bass is
not known and respected.</p>

<p>I mentioned further back Scotch and English
barleys as being employed for malting purposes;
but as a matter of fact the produce of many
countries is used, in a blend, the whole being
divided into two classes, heavy and light. And
in making choice of barleys it is necessary that
they should be thoroughly and equally ripened,
well “got” or harvested, and as far as possible
presented to the brewer in the perfect husk or
envelope with which nature has furnished the
kernel. Ancient and modern modes of thrashing
and dressing to a greater or less extent damage
both the husk and the kernel, and thus at the
very threshold introduce one of the causes of
disease. Whenever the grain is broken or bruised
it is liable to be attacked when moist by a variety
of moulds which lead to more or less serious
disaster.</p>

<p>Of the different varieties of beer, “pale ale”
or “bitter” is a highly-hopped beer made from
the very finest selected malt and hops; whilst
“mild ale,” or as it is called in Scotland “sweet
ale,” is of greater gravity or strength, and is
comparatively lightly hopped. “Old ale” is,
naturally, the best stuff that can be brewed, in a
state of maturity; and it is a
peculiarity of ale <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
that, securely bottled, it will keep its strength far
longer than any other fermented drink. In
December 1889 some bottles of beer were found
walled up in a cellar at Burton-on-Trent; and
the records of the firm, as well as the shape of
the bottles, shewed that the beer had been brewed
nearly a hundred years before. It was as bright
as a sunbeam, and quite drinkable, but had lost
its bitterness, and assumed the character of sherry.
But old ale, like old brandy, is of little value to
the toper, in that it takes a very minute quantity
to accomplish in him the desired effect—oblivion.
“Audit” ales and “college” ditto require very
delicate handling of the jug; and I have tasted
ancient beer in Allsopp’s cellars in Burton, a
wine-glassful of which would probably have put
a coal-whipper on his back. It was the colour
of mahogany and oh! so seductive.</p>

<p>Porter, as most people know, is a black beer,
brewed in much the same manner as the other
stuff, with roasted malt to give it colour; whilst
stout is simply a superior kind of porter. As for
the lager beer of the Fatherland it is fermented
at a very low temperature, the fermentation being
longer delayed. Some years ago great stress was
laid on the German system of mashing called the
“thick mash,” which consisted of boiling or
cooking a portion of the mash, and running it
back and remixing it with the portion left in the
tun; but it is now found possible to brew the
finest lager beer with a slight modification of our
own mashing method.</p>

<p>The sons of Britannia for a considerable
period held aloof from this
lager, which was <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
pronounced by some to be mere “hogwash,” and
by others to consist principally of the juice of
fir-cones and onions mixed with snow-water.
The fir-cone flavour is, I believe, accounted for
by the “pitching” of the barrels in which the
beer is stored; but I don’t know where the
oniony flavour comes from. The prejudice
against this beer has long since departed from
our midst; in fact it has become quite a favourite
summer drink. It is generally considered less
intoxicating than its English cousin. In fact
the German students are in the habit of putting
huge quantities thereof out of sight, on the
occasion of passing examinations, and public
rejoicings; and these “beer-drinkings” are,
apparently, fully sanctioned by the authorities.</p>

<p>It has been written that it is to Dean Nowell,
“classed by Fuller among the worthies of England,”
that we are indebted for the discovery of
bottled beer. According to Fuller, “this worthy,
who was an en­thus­ias­tic fish­er­man, was one day
angling in the Thames; but at the very time
when he was trying to catch perch to carry
to the frying-pan, that benighted bigot Bishop
Bonner was trying to catch him to tie him to
the stake for pur­poses of cremation, to the glory
of the old religion. The reverend gen­tle­man
heard that he was ‘wanted,’ left his fishing, and
fled as far from the Thames as he could, leaving
untasted in a safe place a bottle of beer which
he had filled in the morning. Bonner’s day did
not last long, and Dean Nowell was soon able
to return to his old haunts. Fishing as usual,
he went to look after his bottle
of beer, and <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
found that it had turned into a species of gun—it
exploded its contents, when touched.” Thus
Nature, which is ever kind, turned the martyrdom
and misery of Bloody Mary’s reign to good—it
brought about bottled beer. The Dean un­bos­omed
himself of his great dis­covery to his
clerical friends, and the clergy let it out gradually
to the laity.</p></div><!--section-->

<p>Gervase Markham, the aforementioned con­tem­po­rary
of Shake­speare, gives the fol­low­ing
directions to “the English House­wife” of 1631,
for</p>

<h3><i>Brewing of Bottle-Ale</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Touching the brewing of Bottle-ale, it differeth
nothing at all from the brewing of strong Ale, onely
it must be drawne in a larger proportion, as at least
twenty gallons of halfe a quarter; and when it
comes to be changed, you shall blinke it (as was
before shewed) more by much than was the strong
Ale, for it must bee pretty and sharpe, which giveth
the life and quicknesse to the Ale: and when you
tunne it, you shall put it into round bottles with
narrow mouthes, and then stopping them close with
corke, set them in a cold sellar up to the wast in
sand, and be sure that the corkes be fast tied in
with strong packe-thrid, for feare of rising out, or
taking vent, which is the utter spoyle of the Ale.</p>

<p>Now for the small drinke arising from this Bottle-ale,
or any other beere or ale whatsoever, if you keep it after
it is blinckt and boyled in a close vessell, and then put
it to barme every morning as you have occasion to use
it, the drinke will drinke a great deale the fresher,
and be much more lively in taste. <span class="xxpn"
id="p071">{71}</span></p></blockquote>

<p>I confess that the above directions are somewhat
vague to my untutored mind, which is
quite a blank upon the subject of “blinckt and
boyled” ale. Nor do I imagine for one moment
that the “English Housewife” of the year 1899
will cumber herself with brewing or bottling,
any sort of malt-liquor, as long as there be
bonnets to be chosen, bicycles to be ridden, or
golf to be played.</p>

<p>Wholesome as may be the beer in itself, its
surroundings are not always hygienic. The
system of pumping up the glorious fluid from
the cellar through leaden pipes neither improves
the flavour nor renders it more valuable as a
morning “livener.” And there is a story—which
I believe to be strictly true—told of a
night cabman in London who used to call at the
nearest tavern to his stand, the first thing in the
morning, and swallow the first glass of beer
drawn for the day. His end was lead-poisoning.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>But there! John Barleycorn has probably done far more

<p class="pfirst">“What is a pound?” was a favourite
query of the great Sir Robert Peel. “What is brandy?” is
a question asked now and then; and the answer thereto
should be an ambiguous one. Brandy is supposed, by good
easy people who trouble not to enquire too closely into the
composition of their daily food, to be a liquid obtained
by distilling the fermented juice of the grape. The red
wines are preferable, although in the seventeenth century
the best French brandy was made entirely from white ones.
The original distillation is clear and colourless, but when
placed in casks the liquid dissolves out the colouring
matter of the wood, brown sugar and other pigments being
also added. <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span></p>

<p>But if you want the best French brandy,
distilled from the luscious grape, see that you
get it; and let your vision be in thorough
working order. With the exception of the
good, conscientious spirit-distillers, all French
houses import potato-spirit in large quantities
from Germany, and re-ship it to the home of
the brave and free as superior cognac. This
alone would seem sufficient excuse for another
invasion of France; although these evil-minded
distillers seek to justify their actions by blaming
the <i>phylloxera</i>, a little insect which has
laboured more assiduously in the cause of
temperance—by destroying the main source of
intemperance—than Sir Wilfrid Lawson himself.
“The ravages of the <i>phylloxera</i>,” say the distillers,
in effect, “compel us to employ other <i>matériel</i>,
in order to fulfil our cognac contracts with the
merchants of the perfidious isle.” It is related
of a theatrical “property-man” that, upon
being rebuked by the tragedian for making a
snowstorm out of brown, instead of white, paper,
he replied curtly: “It was the only paper I had;
and if you can’t snow white you must snow
brown.” This excuse is on a par with that
urged on behalf of the German potato-spirit.</p>

<p><i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i> (why not <i>devastatrix</i>?) has
cost France, it is said, a pecuniary loss far exceeding
that of the Franco-Prussian war. The little
monster was discovered in North America in
1854, and whether the discoverer or one of his
friends brought the vine-killer on a holiday-trip
to Europe, or whether it worked its own passage
will never be known. But certain it
is that the <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
little monster made its first appearance on this
side in the year 1863. Striking an attitude,
with the exclamation, “Hallo! here’s a vine,
let’s have the first suck,” the <i>phylloxera</i> commenced
a long starring engagement (to borrow
another metaphor from the theatres), which in
another fifteen years’ time had developed into
an enormous success, as far as the <i>vastatrix</i> was
concerned. Naturally, it is the she-phylly who
does the harm. From August to October Madam
lays her little eggs on the vine-leaves, beneath the
surface. The <i>ova</i> develop late in autumn into males
and females, who migrate to the stem of the vine.
There each bold, bad female lays an egg, under
the bark. This egg lies dormant, after the
manner of pesky little insect-nuisances, through
the winter, and develops in April or May into
a wingless, voracious, merciless little “vine-louse,”
with power to add to its number. “The
rest,” as the mechanical engineers tell us, just
before our brains go, “is easy.” The vine-louse
attacks the roots, without waiting, the silly
idiot, for the grapes to ripen, the vine dies, and
the potato reigns in its stead. Without burning
the plant, or drowning it, it is impossible to eradicate
the <i>phylloxera</i>, without spending three times
as much cash, in chemicals, as the vine is worth.
This is the true story of France’s great trouble.</p>

<p>Beetroot-spirit is also largely used in making
cognac, the coarse spirit being flavoured with
œnanthic æther, cognac-oil (made from palm-oil)
and—other things. Also of late years the
French have discovered that almost as good wine
can be made from raisins as
from the uncooked <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
article, provided they use enough raisins; three
pounds being required to make a gallon of liquor.
A good deal can also be done, in the way of
imitation wine, by chemicals; it being quite
possible to make sherry which will fetch at least
four shillings per bottle, for the ridiculous sum
of fourpence for the same quantity. And it
is also a fact that a large quantity of alleged
claret which (mainly through the endeavours of
the late Mr. W. E. Gladstone) we are able to
import on the cheap from the other side of the
water, is made from currants and raisins steeped
in water and mixed with cheap Spanish wine.</p>

<p>And what is to be said of British brandy?
A country which can man­u­fac­ture superior
Dorset butter from Thames mud, and real turtle-soup
from snails and conger-eels, is not likely to
get “left” in a matter of dis­til­ling. A great
deal of brandy is, therefore, made in the tight
little island from ordinary grain alcohol, by
adding Argol—I’ll tell ye what this is presently—bruised
French plums, French wine-vinegar,
a little—a very little—good cognac, and redistilling.
I believe that it is also possible to
extract a good midnight sort of brandy—specially
rec­om­mend­ed for roysterers—from coal-tar
and paraffin.</p>

<p>The Americans make brandy from peaches and other
stone-fruits, good wholesome liquor, but their French
cognac is not to be rec­om­mend­ed. For it is nothing more
nor less than the common whisky which America has exported
to France, sent back again, after the necessary
<span class="sprghta">treatment.</span>
Fact. <span class="xxpn"
id="p076">{76}</span></p>

<p>Argol, mentioned just now, is a crude variety
of cream of tartar which forms a crust within
wine-vats and bottles. Originally it exists in
the juice of the grape, and is soluble therein;
but during the fermentation of the juice, and as
it passes into wine, much alcohol is developed,
which remaining in the fermenting liquor,
causes the precipitation of Argol. Thus the
“crust” of port wine is Argol, the principal
uses (and abuses) of which are in the preparation
of (besides cognac) cream of tartar and tartaric
acid. And malicious people say that you have
only to scratch French brandy to find the Tartar.</p>

<p>A few years ago a German chemist discovered
that a very drinkable brandy can be made from
sawdust—whether deal sawdust or any description
of dust does not appear; and under the heading,
“A New Danger to Teetotalism,” an American
journal published the following <span class="nowrap">effusion:—</span></p>

<p>“We are a friend of the temperance movement,
and want it to succeed; but what chance can it
have when a man can take a rip-saw and go out
and get drunk with a fence-rail? What is the
use of a prohibitory liquor law if a man is able to
make brandy-smashes out of the shingles on his
roof, or if he can get delirium tremens by drinking
the legs of his kitchen chairs? You may
shut up an inebriate out of a gin shop and keep
him away from taverns, but if he can become
uproarious on boiled sawdust and desiccated
window-sills, any effort must necessarily be a
failure.”</p>

<p>I can believe in the ability of most German
chemists to do most
things; and possibly <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
sawdust is used in the Fatherland for the man­u­fac­ture
of lager beer, Rhine Wine, and—but ’tis a saw
subject.</p>

<p>The pure brandy at Cognac is divided into
two principal classes—“champagne” brandy, from
grapes grown on the plains, and “bois” brandy,
the product of wooded districts—I am <i>not</i> alluding
now to sawdust—and the last-named variety
is subdivided into many different names. It
takes eight and a half gallons of wine to furnish
one gallon of spirits; and the ravages of the vine-louse
have made a terrible difference in the
supply. In fact, the amount produced in 1897
was about one-tenth of the amount produced
twenty years previously. But thanks to beet-root,
potatoes, and—other things, the distiller
manages to “get” there just the same. But the
man who wrote in 1889, prophesying the speedy
disappearance of pure <i>eau de vie</i> from the market,
was probably not far wrong. “It would seem
on the whole,” he wrote, “that unless the
phylloxera be stamped out, pure brandy will soon
be a thing of the past.” But they do not tell
you this in saloon-bars, and places where they
drink.</p>

<p>It was stated by Mr. Dewar last year (1898)
that there were 89,000,000 gallons of whisky
lying idle in bond because sufficient suitable
water to dilute it to the orthodox strength could
not be found. This statement is calculated to
give a moderate drinker the gapes; whilst Sir
Wilfrid Lawson and others must have longed for
permission to set fire to every bonded warehouse
in the Kingdom. But the
same great authority <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
on the wines of bonnie Scotland made another
statement at the same time which is eminently
calculated to remove all fears lest whisky, like
brandy, be on the down line. “The serpent
Alcohol,” remarks a writer in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>,
in discussing Mr. Dewar’s speech, “may
have been scotched”—was this meant for a
joke?—“but it is far from having been killed.”
According to the Ex-Sheriff’s statistics the distillation
of Irish whisky, despite its diminishing
popularity, has increased during the last fourteen
years by about thirty per cent; while in Scotland
during the same period the increase has
been at the rate of nearly eighty per cent.
Ireland, that is to say, which produced eleven
million gallons in 1884, now produces fourteen
million and a half gallons; while the Scotch
output, which was eighteen million gallons in
the former year, had risen in 1898 to the enormous
figure of thirty-three millions and a half.
Hech sirs! these be braw figures indeed.</p>

<p>Yet let not the British be held up to reprobation
as hard drinkers, as long as France is a
going concern. Statistics prove that in Scotland,
the land o’ the barley bree, the consumption of
spirits during the year 1892–93 averaged a little
more than twelve and a half pints per month,
which is little more than the proportion of spirits
required by the Parisians, without wine, absinthe,
and—other things. The boulevardiers are called
“temperate,” although they drink as much spirits
as do the Scots, and thirty times as much wine,
not to mention cider and beer.</p>

<p>Distilling in Britain dates
from the eleventh <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
century, but in the be­gin­ning it was worked
solely in the monasteries by the jovial monks.
What a good time those monks of old would
seem to have had! According to the popular
prints they were usually engaged either in fishing,
eating oysters, drinking out of flagons,
catching beetles, confessing pretty women, or
being shaved; and we know that their abiding-places
were built, for the most part, on the banks
of a river which absolutely swarmed with salmon
or trout, in the midst of a district teeming with
game. Any how the monks made spirits, or
“strong waters” as they were called in those
days, first.</p>

<p>Pure malt whisky is, and has been, made
almost exclusively in Scotland. In Ireland they
use about one-third of malt to two-thirds of oats
and maize. In England they make whisky of
pretty nearly everything, including German spirit,
petroleum, and old boots; whilst in gallant little
Wales—well the only acknowledged Welsh
whisky I have tasted was excellent in quality,
and apparently made from pure malt. Distilling,
as a trade, commenced in England during the
Tudor period, and from the reputation bluff
King Hal bore for feathering his nest, it is
probable that the industry was fully taxed. In
1579 Scotch distilleries were taxed for the first
time. In Ireland as far back as the eleventh century
the natives made <i>uisge beatha</i>—now called
potheen—without interference from landlord or
gauger, and continued at it until the sixteenth
century, when licenses were enforced in the cases
of <i>all but the gentry</i>, and to run an
illicit still was <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
punishable with death and dismemberment. But
they ran ’em just the same; for in those days
an Irishman was never really happy unless he
were drinking, fighting, or being sentenced to
death. But whether it was English, Scotch,
Welsh, or Irish whisky, or French brandy, or
Dutch gin, smuggling and illicit distilling were
rampant through the centuries, and the Inland
Revenue officer was no more respected or worshipped
than at the present day. Still there has
not been much blood shed over those differences
of opinion; except in Western Pennsylvania at
the close of the last century—a period when the
greater part of the universe was fighting about
something—when it took 15,000 soldiers from
Washington to quell a riot amongst a populace
discontented with the Excise regulations.</p>

<p>Blending and diluting whiskies are for the
most part done in the bonded warehouses. “All
commercial spirit,” says an authority on the subject,
“however pure, contains a small proportion
of impurities” (which sounds Irish) “or by-products
of distillation known as fusel-oil.” It
will relieve the minds of some to know that fusel-oil
is merely a by-product of distillation, and
not the “low-flash” stuff which causes the
accidents with the cheap lamps. It used to be
thought that during the “maturing,” or “ageing,”
of whisky the constituents of fusel-oil
underwent decomposition; but my good friend
Doctor James Bell, C.B., the chief Government
analyst at Somerset House (he retired some three
years ago), utterly refuted this theory by analysis.</p>

<p>Whisky is, like brandy,
naturally white, and <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
takes its trade colour, and, to a certain extent,
flavour, from the sherry-casks in which it is
matured. It is also coloured by the direct addition
of caramel (burnt sugar), or a maturing
wine.</p>

<p>In America, Rye or Bourbon whisky is made
from wheat or maize grown in the Bourbon
country, Kentucky, and some of it would kill
at forty yards. The chief distillery states on
the other side of the Atlantic are Illinois, Ohio,
Kentucky, Indiana, New York, and Pennsylvania.
At the Cape, and through­out South Africa, there
is decent whisky procurable, as also a pernicious
compound known as “Square-face” or “Cape
smoke,” and in much favour with the dusky
races of the country. On the Congo, palm-wine—similar
to the fermented toddy of the East
Indies—was for centuries the only livener, but
with the march of civilization have come the
whiskies of Great Britain, more or less adulterated;
and whereas in the past death by the
sword, or the club, was the only known punishment
for the subjects of the native tyrants who
are so fond of thinning out the population, a
well-fuselled whisky is now freely employed for
the same purpose.</p>

<p>Although whisky is now freely partaken of
all over Great Britain, it was comparatively speaking
despised in England until the first half of
the present century had slipped by. This fact
is apparent from a perusal of contemporary literature.
And in no country has “malt” had such a
rise in public estimation as in the great continent
of Hindustan, where “John
Exshaw” and “John <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
Collins”—the last named a seductive compound
of gin, limes, Curaçoa, and soda-water—have
been almost knocked out by John Barleycorn
and Jean Pomme-de-terre. Until the visit of
H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, brandy was almost
the sole potation of the heroes who helped to
hold the big wonderland, the old-fashioned <i>brandi-pani</i>
gradually giving place to the brandy diluted
with <i>Belati pani</i>, or “Europe water.” Thirty
years ago a “peg” meant a brandy-and-soda;
but whisky has now usurped the proud position
once occupied by the products of John Exshaw,
Justerini and
Brooks, and others.</p>

<p class="pfirst">We now come to Rum, “superior old
Jamaica pine-apple,” otherwise known as “sailors’ tea”—the
spirit in question having from time im­me­mo­rial been held
in high esteem by mariners both afloat and ashore. Rum
is probably one of the easiest beverages to make, being,
simply, fermented and distilled cane-sugar. Occasionally
pine-apples and guavas are thrown into the still, but in
making this spirit on a large scale no attempts are made
to add to its flavour and thereby deduct from the profits
to be made on the commodity. It is coloured with caramel,
and the longer you keep it the better and, therefore, the
more valuable, it becomes. In the city <span class="xxpn"
id="p084">{84}</span> of Carlisle in the year 1865 some
rum known to be 140 years old was sold for
£3&#x202f;:&#x202f;3s. per
bottle.</p>

<p>This is not the brand served out to our
army and navy; although the “tots” issued
periodically to Tommy Atkins and Ben Bowline
consist of good, sound liquor, wholesome enough,
save for gouty subjects—and a sailor with the
gout would be of about as much use to his Queen
and country as a watch without works—and
writing from past experience I can aver that
every drop of liquor, whether ale or rum, supplied
in a regimental canteen had to be previously
passed by a committee of “taste.” In many ships,
nowadays, no rum or other intoxicant is served
out; and as no equivalent is given, it might
appear as though the owners made a good thing
out of the temperate habits of their crews. But
I do not believe in total abstinence as an aid to
work; and I have never seen a sailor the worse—on
board ship—for his “tot.” On the other hand,
in the old days of “Green’s” troop-ships, the old
sailing-vessels which made the voyage to India
round the Cape of Good Hope, it was by no
means infrequent for a soldier to be “overcome”
by the cane-spirit, of which he occasionally got
rather more than his orthodox allowance.</p>

<p>How was this managed? The thrifty seafarers
were in the habit of selling their grog
allowance to the “swaddies”; and as soon as the
ship’s captain found this out, he issued stringent
regulations which it might have been expected
would put a stop to this practice. When all
hands were piped to grog a
ship’s officer was <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span>
stationed by the tub, to see that each sailor drank
his allowance. Still there was intoxication
amongst the troops, and it was discovered that
many of the sailors’ pannikins had false bottoms,
and that in this way the rum was concealed.
After that the ship’s officer was enjoined to see
that each sailor partook of his tot; but even this
precaution failed; for the rum would be ejected
from the men’s mouths into a bucket in the
fo’c’sle, and then sold—a disgusting practice
which merited severe punishment, and frequently
obtained it.</p>

<p>We English do not make nearly as much use of
rum in cookery as do our lively neighbours. One
of the most approved of <i>entremets</i> is an <i>omelette au
rhum</i>, a truly grateful dish, if the omelette be
properly made, although rum be spelt with an “h.”
But it is a mistake to use rum-sauce with plum-pudding,
as do the French; for brandy is a far
better digestive of the cloying materials of which
the pudding is composed. As mentioned in
<i>Cakes and Ale</i>, rum-and-milk is said, by the
chief English authority on dietetics, to be the
most powerful restorative known to man. This
may, or may not, be true; I am prepared to back
a judicious dose of “the Boy”—<i>not</i> limited to a
“split pint,” either. But of all horrible mixtures,
defend me from rum-and-ale, which used to be
a potion much in favour with the dangerous
classes of our metropolis, in the days when I
went “slumming” in search of plain unvarnished
facts. A steaming tumbler of rum and hot
water, with a piece of butter melted therein, was,
in my younger days, in vogue
as an infallible <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
specific to eject a cold from the head. Nowadays,
I prefer the cold.</p>

<p>Gin is supposed by students, who do not make
practical test of their learning, to be distilled
from malt, or from unmalted barley, or from
some other grain, and afterwards rectified and
flavoured. And just as it was (according to
Mr. Samuel Weller) the seasoning which did it
in the case of the cheap pies, so is it the rectifying,
and the flavouring which do it, in the matter
of gin. Occasionally “rectifying” is hardly the
right word to use. That there is such a thing
as wholesome, tolerably-pure gin is more than
probable; but there is also a very undesirable
fluid sold to the poorer classes, and esteemed by
their vitiated palates, known under different pet
names, of which “blue ruin” and “white satin”
are two. This brand of gin is flavoured more or
less with oil of turpentine and common salt.
No wonder thirst stalks abroad next morning!</p>

<p>“In one well-known hostelry,” observes a
writer in a daily newspaper, “situated not a stone’s
throw from the Bank of England, you can, if
you be so minded, ask for and obtain a farthing’s
worth of gin. It is served in tiny liqueur-glasses,
and the custom dates from the time when the
purchasing power of the coin in question was
far greater than it is now, and when consequently,
a farthing’s worth of gin was considered
to be a sufficient quantity for any respectable
citizen. Another public-house, in Bishopsgate
Street, is also compelled, by the terms of its
license, to supply a farthing’s worth of either
‘gin, rum, or shrub,’ to
any customer requiring <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
it; while not far away is a hostelry which is
permitted to carry on the dual businesses of
liquor-dispensing or pawnbroking. Yet another
City public-house possesses a sort of annexe
where medicines are retailed. Handy, this, for
the unhappy sufferer from swelled head.”</p>

<p>I suppose as the above has appeared in a newspaper,
it is strictly true. But how sad! Although
my knowledge of London is “peculiar”
I cannot say I am acquainted with the licensed
house in which drawing drinks and taking in
pledges are combined; but I have seen farthing’s
worths of “Old Tom” dispensed in more than
one hostelry, to slatternly women, before my
own breakfast hour, and I have shuddered at the
sight. But why stop short at selling medicines
in the annexe of a dram shop? I should have
thought an undertaker, in another compartment,
might do a fairish trade.</p>

<p>These are some of the ingredients put into
gin, to give it “body,” and make it “bite”—gin
without teeth being notoriously inferior tipple
and altogether unfit for the consumption of the
good ladies who are, sad to say, by far the best
customers of the gin retailer:—roach-alum (this
sounds fishy), salt of tartar, oil of juniper, cassia,
nutmeg, lemon, fennel, and carraway and coriander
seeds, cardamoms, capsicums, and sulphuric
acid. All these, mind ye, besides the afore-mentioned
oil of turpentine, and the afore-mentioned
potato-spirit, which last would seem
to enter into most drinks of the day.</p>

<p>The word “Gin” is really an abbreviation of
“Geneva,” under which name the
spirit was at <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
one time known. Not that it is principally
man­u­fac­tured in picturesque Switzerland, where
the watches come from; but “Geneva” is a
corruption of the old French word <i>genevre</i>, the
juniper. I used to read, in childhood’s days, that</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Juniper berries and barley make gin,</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">but those ingredients—or the berries, at all
events—would seem to be only regularly used in
Holland, nowadays.</p>

<p>“Dirty” gin, of which we used to hear so
much, was, I believe, as pure as any other
geneva, and not less clean. Plymouth gin is
said to be the healthiest form of the article, but
’tis an acquired taste, and “Old Tom” is certainly
more toothsome. In entering as fully
into details as I have above I have no wish to
discourage the consumption of gin proper, especially
when blended with ginger-beer (an excellent
summer beverage), or doing duty in a cock-tail,
a sling, a punch, or a John Collins. But I am
not a “gin man” myself. And to my mind a
“nip” less calculated to promote appetite than
any other is a “gin-and-bitters.”</p>

<p>“Kosher” rum, <i>i.e.</i> rum treated according to
instructions laid down in the Mosaic Law, is in
high favour with the Jews; and in some of the
taverns which abut on the Israelitish quarters
which are about Aldgate there are recognized
“rum-rooms.” There used to be, and probably
is at the present day, a considerable amount of
card—playing (<i>spieling</i>) or throwing of dice for
wagers, carried on in these apartments; and I
once knew a son of Judah who
was heavily fined <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
by the stipendiary magistrate, for gambling on
licensed premises. To the day of his death this
Jew protested his innocence of the crime.</p>

<p>He told me the whole story, interlarded with
tears and gesticulations.</p>

<p>The <i>rozzers</i> (detectives) raided the rum-room
one afternoon, and created considerable commotion.
Some of the imbibers managed to make
their escape, but my informant was not so fortunate.
He was seized by one minion of the law,
and shortly afterwards another officer cried:</p>

<p>“See where he has hidden the dice in his
tumbler of Old Jamaica!”</p>

<p>“And, may I die,” added the poor Yid, “if
the <i>gonoph</i> (rascal) hadn’t placed ’em there himself—don’t
yer beliefe me?”</p>

<p>Of course I did.</p>

<p>Here is another way of employing rum; but
you will not be able to shine at solo-whist afterwards.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Rum Booze.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The yolks of eight eggs well beaten up, with some sifted
sugar, and a grated nutmeg; extract the juice from rind
of a lemon by rubbing loaf sugar thereon; put the sugar,
a piece of cinnamon, and a bottle of white wine into a
clean saucepan, and when the wine boils take it off the
fire. Pour one glass of cold sherry into it, put it into a
spouted jug (I don’t mean hypothecated, but a jug with a
spout to it) and pour it gradually amongst the egg mixture,
keeping the whole well stirred with a spoon as the wine is
poured in. Sweeten to taste, and pour the mixture from one
vessel to another until a fine white froth is obtained.
<span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span></p>

<p>The recipe continues. “Half a pint of rum is sometimes
added, but it is then very intoxicating.”</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>But <i>sans</i> rum whence the Rum Booze?
Port Wine is sometimes substituted for white
wine, but is not considered so palatable. This
liquor should be drunk when quite hot. If the
wine be poured boiling hot among the eggs, the
mixture will become curdled.</p>

<p><i>Without</i> the rum the mixture is one form of
Egg Flip.</p>

<p>When treating of gin I should have mentioned
that at one well-known City hostelry,
“The Olde Cheshyre Cheese” in Wine Office
Court, Fleet Street, gin is never known by any
other name than “rack.” Why, I know not.
But in the same old tavern should you require
Scotch Whisky you must call for “Scotch,” without
mentioning the word whisky; and if Irish,
“Cork”
is the password.</p>

into a tub of ice, and when it has remained there
one hour it will be fit for use. The balm and
borage should be fresh gathered. And here a few
words as to the virtues of these.</p></blockquote>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>In <i>Evelyn’s Acetaria</i>
it is written:—“The <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
sprigs of borage in wine are of known virtue, to
revive the hypochondriac, and cheer the hard
student.”</p>

<p><i>Salmon’s Household Companion</i>, 1710, told us:
“Borage is one of the four cordial flowers;
it comforts the heart, cheers mel­an­choly, and
revives the fainting spirits.”</p>

<p>“Borage,” wrote Sir John Hill, M.D., “has
the credit of being a great cordial; throwing it
into cold wine is better than all the medicinal
preparations.”</p>

<p>“The leaves, flowers, and seeds of borage,”
says the <i>English Physician</i>, “all or any of them,
are good to expel pensiveness and mel­an­choly.”</p>

<p>“Balm is very good to help digestion and
open obstructions of the brain, and hath so much
purging quality in it, as to expel those mel­an­choly
vapours from the spirits and blood which
are in the heart and arteries, although it cannot
do so in other parts of the body” (<i>Ibid</i>).</p>

<p>After all this information, let not the garden
of the mel­an­choly vapourer be searched in vain
for balm and borage.</p>

<p class="pfirst">In <i>Cakes and Ale</i>, grave doubts are
expressed as to whether the usually-accepted derivation
of punch is the correct one. Why Asia should be raked to
find a name for a purely European concoction, is beyond my
powers of argument; and, as observed in another place, in
the concoction of this seductive brew it is by no means
necessary to limit oneself to <i>five</i> ingredients.</p>

<p>It may be news to the adopters of the <i>panch</i>
(five) theory to read that punch was at one time <span
class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span> called “pale-punts,”
why or wherefore de­po­nent sayeth not; here is the extract
from a work published <span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> <span
class="nowrap">1691:—</span></p>

<p>“Pale-punts, here vulgarly known by the
name of Punch; a drink compounded of brandy
or <i>aqua vitæ</i>, juice of lemons, oranges, sugar, or
such like; very usual amongst those that frequent
the sea, where a bowl of punch is an usual
beverage.”</p>

<p>But it was “usual” only in the days of sailing-ships
and long voyages; and with fast steamers
and whole evenings devoted to the beauties of
poker, or selling pools, a more usual modern
mari­time drink is a mod­i­cum of whisky diluted
with aërated water.</p>

<p>“The liquor called Punch,” writes another
professional authority, “has become so truly
English, it is often supposed to be indigenous to
this country, though its name at least is Oriental.
The Persian <i>punj</i>, or Sanscrit <i>pancha</i>,
i.e.
five
(vide <i>Fryer’s Travels</i>), is the etymon of its title,
and denotes the number of ingredients of which
it is composed. Addison’s ‘fox-hunter,’ who
testified so much surprise when he found that of
the materials of which this ‘truly English’
beverage was made only the water belonged to
England, would have been still more astonished
had his informant also told him that it derived
even its name from the East.”</p>

<p>But did natives of the East drink it? Tell
me that.</p>

<p>“Various opinions are enter­tained respect­ing
this com­pound drink. Some au­thors praise it as
a cool­ing and re­fresh­ing
beverage, when drunk <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span>
in mod­er­a­tion; others con­demn the use of it as
prejudicial to the brain and nervous system. Dr.
Cheyne, a celebrated Scotch physician, author of
an essay on ‘Long Life and Health,’ and who
by a system of diet and regimen reduced himself
from the enormous weight of thirty-two stone to
nearly one-third, which enabled him to live to
the age of seventy-two, insists that there is but
one wholesome ingredient in it, and that is the
water. Dr. Willich, on the contrary, asserts that
if a proper quantity of acid be used in making
punch, it is an excellent antiseptic, and well
calculated to supply the place of wine in resisting
putrefaction, especially if drank cold with plenty
of sugar; it also promotes perspiration; but if
drank hot and immoderately it creates acidity in
the stomach, weakens the nerves, and gives rise
to complaints of the breast. He further states
that after a heavy meal it is improper, as it may
check digestion, and injure the stomach.</p>

<p>“Rennie states that he once heard a facetious
physician at a public hospital prescribe for a poor
fellow sinking under the atrophy of starvation a
bowl of punch. Mr. Wadd gives us a <span class="nowrap">prescription:—</span></p>

<p>“&#x202f;‘Rum, aqua dulci miscetur acetum, et fiet ex
tali fœdere nobile Punch.’</p>

<p>“He also states that toddy, or punch without
acid, when made for a day or two before it is
used, is a good and cheap substitute for wine as
a tonic, in convalescence from typhus fever, etc.”</p>

<p>It is here worthy of note that what is meant
by “punch” in Ireland is, and has been for at
least two centuries, whisky,
sugar, lemon, and <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span>
the less water the better. A very old way of
concocting it is to melt the sugar within the
tumbler (which should be covered, <i>pro tem.</i>) with
the smallest quantity of water sufficient for the
purpose, the thin lemon-rind having been
previously added. Then comes the whisky;
“and,” according to the old formula, “the laste
dhrop o’ wather” added atop of the “crathur”
will spoil the punch. But in all English works
in which punch has been mentioned—previous
to the early seventies, at all events—by the active
ingredients of punch should be understood either
rum, brandy, or gin.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3>“<i>English Punch</i>,”</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">says a writer of our own time, “is,
as regards the spirit, mostly of two kinds—brandy and rum,
mixed in proportions which must be left to taste. The rum
generally predominates. The acid is nearly always lemon
juice. The spice is nearly always lemon-peel, but sometimes
tea-leaf”—now marry come up!—“sometimes nutmeg; and as for
the sugar and the water they explain themselves.”</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>The Scotch make toddy in very much the
same way as the Irish concoct their punch. But</p>

<h3><i>Glasgow Punch</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">according to John Gibson Lockhart, was
compounded with the coldest spring-water—a commodity which
would seem to be growing somewhat scarce in Caledonia—for
the purpose of punch-making, at all events. <span
class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span></p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>The sugar being melted with a little cold water,
the artist squeezed about a dozen lemons through a
wooden strainer, and then poured in water enough
almost to fill the bowl. In this state the liquor
goes by the name of sherbet, and a few of the
connoisseurs in his immediate neigh­bour­hood were
requested to give their opinion of it—for in the
mixing of the sherbet lies, according to the Glasgow
creed at least, one half of the whole battle. This
being approved by an audible smack from the lips
of the umpires, the rum was added to the beverage,
I suppose in something about the proportion of one
to <span class="nowrap">seven&#x202f;<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2015twice.png"
width="265" height="120" alt="――" />.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Hech <span class="sprghta">sirs&#x202f;!</span>
Or, does it mean seven of rum
to one of the spring?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last of all the maker cut a few limes, and running
each section rapidly round the rim of his bowl,
squeezed in enough of this more delicate acid to
flavour the whole composition. In this consists the
true <i>tour-de-maître</i> of the punch-maker.</p></blockquote>

<h3><i>Oxford Punch</i><br />or<br />
<i>Classical Sherbet</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">is a very ancient beverage, and from
the sustaining powers of the calves’-foot jelly (under what
heading, amongst punch ingredients, does this come, by
the way?) inserted therein might fairly pose as meat and
drink.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

sweeten it with a bottle of capillaire (the recipe for
this follows), and add half a pint of white wine, a
pint of French brandy, a pint of Jamaica rum, and
a bottle of orange shrub; the mixture to be stirred
as the spirits are poured in. If not sufficiently sweet,
add loaf-sugar, or a little more capillaire. To be
served either hot or cold.</p></blockquote>

<p>In making the punch limes are sometimes
used instead of lemons, but are not so wholesome;
in fact Arbuthnot, in his work on
aliments, says: “The West India dry gripes are
occasioned by lime-juice in punch.” And
nobody wants them.</p>

<p>Ignorant servants sometimes put oxalic acid
into punch, to give it a flavour; but unless the
throats of the drinkers be lined with brass, this
acid is of no real service. And the host who
would entrust the making of any sort of punch
to a subordinate, must be either very ignorant, or
very careless of the comfort of his guests—and
possibly both. Cups, punches, and salads should
always be concocted by somebody who will make
personal trial of their merits.</p>

lumps of sugar on the peel of a lemon, put them
into a jug with the above, and half a pint of lemon
juice, stirring the mixture well as it is poured in.
Then add one quart of old brandy. Strain and
bottle off, and in cold weather it will keep a fortnight.</p></li>

gallon of cold spring-water; add thereto a quarter
of a pint of orange-flower water, with the juice of

pour one quart of boiling milk into it, and then add
three bottles of old brandy, and a like quantity of
orange brandy shrub. Strain and bottle off.</p></li>

<li><p>3. Cut the peeling of six Seville oranges and six
lemons very thin. Pound in a stone mortar. Add
one pint of brandy and let the mixture stand six
hours, covered. Then squeeze in the juice of six
Seville oranges and eight lemons. Stir well, and
add three more pints of brandy, three pints of rum,
and three quarts of water. Make two quarts of
milk boiling hot, and grate a nutmeg into it; mix
this gradually with the other ingredients, and add a
sufficient quantity of loaf-sugar to sweeten it—about
two pounds. Stir till the sugar is dissolved; let
the mixture stand twelve hours, then strain through
a jelly-bag until quite clear. Bottle off, and it will
keep in any climate for any length of time.</p></li>

<p>Put into a small tumbler a teaspoonful of sugar,
half a wine-glassful of old brandy, half a wine-glassful
of old rum, and fill up with boiling milk.</p></li>

rinds of three Seville oranges, and three
lemons. Cork tightly for two days. Rub off on
two pounds loaf-sugar the rinds of six lemons, squeeze
the juice of the fruit over the two pounds sugar, add
one quart of boiling water, and one of boiling milk.
Mix well till the sugar is dissolved, and grate a little
nutmeg over the mixture. Pour in the rum or
brandy, stir, and strain till clear: bottle off.</p></li>

<li><p>7. Cut off the thin yellow rind of four lemons
and one Seville orange, taking care not to include
even a fragment of the <i>white</i> rind, and place in a
basin. Pour in a bottle of old rum, and let it stand,
covered over, for twelve hours. Then strain, and
mix with it one pint of lemon juice, and two pints of
cold water, in which one pound of sugar-candy has
been dissolved; add the whites of two eggs, beaten
to a froth, three pints more of rum, one pint of
madeira, one pint of strong green tea, and a wine-glassful
of maraschino. Mix thoroughly, and pour
over all one pint of boiling milk. Let the punch

potations, some of which I have personally tested,
others of which not all the wealth of Golconda,
Peru, and Throgmorton Street would induce me
to sample of my own accord, and all of which
bring more or less trouble in their wake.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>Gall and wormwood have been closely allied
from time im­me­mo­rial; and it is in accordance
with the eternal fitness of things that the consumption
of</p>

<h3><i>Absinthe</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">should be almost entirely confined to France.
And what is absinthe?
Merely alcohol, in <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
which have been macerated for a week or so the
pounded leaves and flowering tops of wormwood,
together with angelica root, sweet-flag root, star-anise,
and other aromatics. The liquor is then
distilled, and the result is the decoctions sacred
to the “little green fairy,” who has accomplished
even more manslaughter than the Mahdi, the
Khalifa, and the Peculiar People, put together.
Of all the liqueurs absinthe is the most pernicious;
and with many other sins it occupies some time
in taking possession of its victim. Like Mr.
Chevalier’s hero, you “have to know it fust,”
and after that the rest is easy. Like golf,
“scorching,” and gambling, once you “get”
absinthe, it gets you, and never leaves you whilst
you last; and there is a weird, almost tragic,
look about the milky liquid, when diluted with
water, as to suggest smoke, and brimstone, and
flames, with a demon rising from their midst.
But it is only “the little green fairy”; who is,
however, as deadly and determined as any demon.</p>

<p>The best absinthe is made in the canton of
Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and is not made entirely
from Wormwood proper, but from a mixture of
plants related to it—such as Southernwood (“Old
Man”), and another which takes its name from
the invulnerable Achilles. But the merry Swiss
boy knows a trick worth two of drinking
absinthe; so the French get the most of it,
whilst some goes to America, and some to the
foreign quarters of our great metropolis. The
French soldiers learnt to appreciate it, from
drinking it as a febrifuge, during the Algerian
campaign, 1832–47, and
it afterwards became, <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
gradually, a popular drink on the boulevards,
where the five o’clock gossip-hour at the <i>cafés</i>
came to be known as “the hour of absinthe.”
Its use is now forbidden in the French army and
navy, and no wonder. The evil effects of drinking
it are very apparent: utter derangement of
the digestive system, weakened frame, limp
muscles, pappy brain, jumpy heart, horrible
dreams and hallucinations, with paralysis or
idiocy to bring down the curtain.</p>

<p>In that seductive, though gruesome book,
<i>Wormwood</i>, Marie Corelli gives a most graphic
picture of an <i>absintheur</i>, once a gay young
banker, who, through trouble of no ordinary
kind, gradually came under the spell of the
“green fairy.” I forget how many murders he
committed; but his awful experiences and
hallucinations will never leave anybody who has
read the book. He is haunted for some days by
a leopard who accompanies him on his walks
abroad, and who lies down at the foot of his bed
at night-time—the “jim-jams,” in fact, in their
worst form.</p>

<p>“There are two terrible verses,” says a writer
on the subject, “in the Revelations of St. John.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“And the third angel sounded his trumpet, and
there fell a great star from the heavens, burning like
a lamp, and it fell upon a third part of the rivers
and upon the fountains of waters. And the name
of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part
of the waters became Wormwood, and many men
died of the waters because they were made bitter.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Which seems a
very appropriate quotation; <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
yet will men drink of the waters, for although
absinthe makes the heart grow blacker, and the
pulse more feeble, men—and, occasionally women—will
continue, as long as there is a world, to do
the thing they ought not to do. With which
moralising let us pass to the next objectionable
drink,</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Arrack.</i></h3>

<p>This is an East Indian name, derived from
the Arabic, for all sorts of distilled spirits, but
chiefly for the “toddy,” or palm-liquor obtained
from the cocoa-palm, as also from rice, and the
coarse brown sugar known to the natives as
“jaggery.” “Toddy,” when fresh, is a delicious
drink, and bears no sort of relationship to whisky-toddy.
An almost nude male swarms up a
cocoa-palm—assisted by a rope which encircles
his ankles and the trunk of the tree—early in the
morning, and fetches down the vessel which has
been fastened up atop, overnight, to catch the
sap which has dripped from the incisions made in
the tree. That sap, in its raw state, is delicious—especially
with a dash of rum in it, but it
ferments rapidly, and usually turns sour in three
or four days. Then the natives distil, and make
“arrack” of it—a liquor which is sold in the
bazaars and drunk on the occasion of a <i>burra din</i>,
or festival. Nor is its use confined to natives.
The British soldier drinks it, <i>faute de mieux</i>;
and occasionally the British officer.</p>

<p>Poor <span class="nowrap">B<img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/u2015twice.png" width="265" height="120"
alt="――" />,</span> who was in my old regiment, had fuddled
himself into such a state of stupidity, that all liquor
was forbidden him by the doctor’s <span class="xxpn"
id="p119">{119}</span> orders. I, who shared his bungalow,
took particular care that these orders were carried out,
and threatened his <i>bearer</i> and <i>khitmugar</i> with fearful
penalties should they convey any surreptitious alcohol to
the <i>sahib</i>. Still he managed to get it; and it took me a
week to find out <i>how</i>. His <i>syce</i> (groom) used to smuggle
arrack from the bazaar, and hide it under the horse’s
bedding in the stable; and whenever I was away from the
house, poor <span class="nowrap">B<img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/u2015twice.png" width="265" height="120"
alt="――" /></span> used to creep over to the stable, and
“soak” there!</p>

<p>An imitation arrack may be made by dissolving
10 grains of benzoic acid in a pint of rum;
but arrack is just the sort of fluid which ought
not to be imitated. Give me the honest, manly,
simple, beautiful Bass!</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Bhang</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">another dreadful East Indian drink, and a deadly
intoxicant, is distilled from hemp; and if it had
only been round the neck of the inventor before
he invented it, society would have benefited.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Saké</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">the favourite beverage of the Japs,
who got it from the Chinese, and improved upon it, is not
a desirable swallow. It is a rapid intoxicant, but the
over-estimator rapidly recovers the perpendicular. <i>Saké</i>
was handed round as a liqueur, at the much-advertised
banquet of the “Thirteen Club”; but it is said that
the liqueur was in no sub­se­quent request. Not even one
of those <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
daring and adventurous mirror-smashers and
salt-spillers express the desire to take-on <i>saké</i> “in a
moog.”</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Vodka</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">is the “livener” of
the Russian peasantry, and is distilled
from—what?</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Plain Water</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">whether
fortunately or otherwise, comes under
the heading of “Strange Swallows.” It is still
consumed in prisons, and other places where
sinners and paupers are dieted at the expense of
the ratepayer. And hard as are the ways of
the transgressor, his daily “quencher” is even
harder. “Plain water,” wrote a celebrated
Mongolian of his day, “has a malignant influence,
and ought on no account to be drunk.”
More especially if it be Thames water. I once
saw a drop of this, very much magnified, displayed
on a stretched cloth, in a side-show at the
Crystal Palace. In that drop of water I counted
three boa-constrictors, a few horrors which resembled
giant lobsters, and a pair of turtles engaged,
apparently, in a duel to the death. Three ladies
in the front row of the stalls, at that exhibition,
were carried out, swooning.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>Whether cold water ought to be drunk, or
not, I am bound, as a tolerably truthful chronicler,
to remark that very few folk who can obtain any
other sort of tipple do drink it.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>It has been claimed by the Brahmins that <span
class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span></p>

<h3><i>The Original Intoxicant</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">was evolved from the climbing bindweed of
Hindustan, one of the con­vol­vu­lus fam­i­ly.
From this was made a liquor called <i>Soma</i>, which
is still the sacred beverage of the Hindus. It is
the Persian <i>Haoma</i>, and, I should imagine,
“absolutely beastly” to the Christian taste.
Everybody knows the Christian bindweed—the
stuff you get in your garden when you set
potatoes, or early peas.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>Pulque, which is the sap of the aloe, is the
favourite drink of the Mexicans. In Kamtchatka
the natives drink (or used to drink) birch-wine,
which has been already described in these pages.
The Russians, also, are very fond of birch-wine;
and their’s effervesces, like champagne.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>In Patagonia they drink</p>

<h3><i>Chi Chi</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">a cider made from wild apples. Pits are dug,
and lined with the hides of horses, to prevent
any liquor escaping, the apples are thrown in,
and left to decay, and ferment, “on their own.”
The Patagonians have an annual “big drink”
of this dreadful mess, besides many smaller boosing-bouts.
And upon these occasions the Patagonian
ladies are in the habit of hiding all the
knives and lethal weapons they can find, and
retiring, with their children, into the woods,
until their lords and masters and other relatives
have drunk themselves mad, and then slept
themselves sober again. <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span></p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>In the Caucasus district there be strange
drinks made from mares’ milk, sparkling—such
as <i>Koumiss</i>, or otherwise. But these beverages
do not have a large sale in other districts.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Kafta</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">which hardly comes under the heading of
“swallows,” is in much request amongst the
Arabs, especially in the neigh­bour­hood of Yemen.
These people boil the leaves and stems of the
<i>kat</i>—a shrub about ten feet high, which is
planted in the same ground as the coffee—and
chew them. All visitors are presented with
twigs of this <i>kat</i> plant to chew; and the drawing-room
carpet suffers terribly.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>“Very pleasant sensations” are, it is said,
caused by this custom, and the effect is so invigorating
that the Arab soldier who goes in
steadily for <i>Kafta</i> can do “sentry go” all night
without feeling in the least drowsy. Whether
the soldiers of the Khalifa did much chewing on
the night before the battle of Omdurman deponent
sayeth not. Frequently the <i>kat</i> leaves
are boiled in milk sweetened with honey, and
the result is the same. The infusion is intoxicating,
but the effect is not of long endurance;
and at a synod of the most learned Mahomedans
it was pronounced lawful for the faithful to chew,
or drink <i>Kafta</i>, “as, whilst it did not impair
the health nor hinder the observance of religious
duties, it increased hilarity and good humour.”
Sly rogues, these followers of the Prophet!</p>

<p>If a man wants to retain his
old friends and <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
to make fresh ones let not that man take to
selling wines or spirits on commission. Some
years ago I gave an old schoolfellow an order for
a case of Scotch whisky, which he declared upon
oath to be absolutely the best procurable. Home
came the whisky, and the first cork was drawn.
Pop! The stuff was literally effervescent, like
champagne, or Russian birch-wine. “My dear,”
I observed to the partner of my joys and cares,
“we had better not drink much of this.”</p>

<p>At the next Sandown Park race-meeting I
met the whisky agent, who, I forgot to mention
before, was a bit of a stammerer.</p>

<p>“And wh-wh-wh-what,” he asked, “d’you
think of that wh-wh-wh-wh-whisky?”</p>

<p>Stammering is occasionally to be caught.</p>

<p>“I think,” was my reply, “it’s the d-d-d-dashedest
m-m-m-muck I ever t-t-t-t-tasted.”</p>

<p>“Wh-wh-what’s the m-m-m-matter with it?”</p>

<p>“It f-f-f-fizzes like g-g-g-ginger p-p-p-pop.”</p>

<p>“My d-d-dear sir,” he protested, “that is no
dr-dr-drawback. That’s the p-p-p-peat-r-r-reek.”</p>

<p>Peat-reek or no, that whisky was not used
for household purposes-not even for the Christmas
pudding; but was kept for the special benefit
of such police-constables, Inland Revenue officers,
process-servers, tax-gatherers, book agents, and
retailers of certain winners, as might call around,
with a thirst in them.</p>

<p>Strange whisky reminds me of the American
story of the proprietor of a spirit-store in Arizona,
who found the ordinary brand of “Rye” was not
sufficiently attractive to his customers. So he
fitted together a blend of his
own, consisting of <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
essence of ginger, capsicums, croton oil, snuff,
carbolic acid, pain-killer, turpentine, and a little
very young and very potent spirit distilled from
old junk. He placed a bottle of this on the
counter, and the first customer who came along
helped himself to a tumblerful, and, taking it
“straight,” swallowed it at a gulp.</p>

<p>As soon as he had got his second wind, he
gasped out: “That’s the best doggoned whisky
I’ve sampled in this yer camp. Sonny, guess
you’ve fixed me up to rights. It’s like swallerin’
a circ’lar saw and pullin’ it up again. So
long.”</p>

<p>And with the tears pouring down his cheeks,
and holding on to his diaphragm with both hands,
he staggered into the open. The saloon-keeper
watched him from the doorway, until he had
passed the second block, and rounded the corner;
and returned to his counter and his bottles, with
the pious exclamation: “The Lord be praised.!
He hasn’t died in our parish!”</p>

<p>No chapter on strange drinks would be complete
without the following story, which, I confess
at the outset, is one of the most venerable of
“chestnuts.” It appeared in the <i>Sporting Times</i>
four-and-twenty years ago, and I will not affirm
that it was strictly original even then. It has
since been translated into every known language;
but it is just possible that some of the rising
generation may not have heard it.</p>

<p>A well-dressed gentleman entered a chemist’s
shop one morning, evidently in a violent hurry.</p>

<p>“Can you make me up a dose of castor-oil?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir,” said the dispenser,
with a bow. <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span></p>

<p>Whilst he was going through the usual
motions—no prescription can be properly made
up until the chemist has overhauled every bottle
on the top shelf, opened most of the empty
drawers, and upset a tray of tooth-brushes—the
customer was fidgeting about the shop, and
fanning himself with a scented pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>“It’s infernally hot,” he said presently, “and
I don’t think I ever felt so thirsty in my life.
Can I have a bottle of lemonade?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>More sorting of <span class="sprghta">bottles.</span>
Presently “pop” goes a cork, and the sparkling lemonade is
poured into a mammoth tumbler. The customer drains it at
once.</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h!” he crowed, wiping his mouth. “I feel a bit
better now.”</p>

<p>A pause. Presently he <span
class="nowrap">asked:—</span></p>

<p>“Have you made that up yet?”</p>

<p>“What, sir?” asked the chemist.</p>

<p>“Why that stuff—the castor-oil I ordered.”</p>

<p>“You’ve had it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Had <span class="sprghta">it&#x202f;!</span> Wotty mean?”</p>

<p>“I gave it you in the lemonade, sir.”</p>

<p>“Great Scotland Yard&#x202f;!” exclaimed the
customer. “I didn’t want it for myself—I’m
going to be married in
half an hour!”</p>

<p class="pcontinue">sings Giroflé, in Lecocq’s opera; and
although the sparkling liquor therein is described in the
text as “punch”—which does <i>not</i> sparkle much as a rule—I
have no doubt whatever that what Lecocq, or his librettist
meant, was the grateful liquid which is described in
different circles of society as “fiz,” “Simpkin” (the
nearest approach a Mahomedan table-servant can make to
“champagne”), “a bottle,” “golden pop,” and “the Boy.”</p>

<p>Here let me interpolate the commonly-received <span
class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span> interpretation of the
last-named title. At a shooting party, a stout urchin of
some fifteen summers was specially told off to carry the
liquid refreshment for the shooters, which took the form of
Perrier Jouët in magnums. And so frequent were the calls of
“Boy!” that morning, that the youth threw up his situation
before noon.</p>

<p>D’you believe it? Not a word of it? Same
here. At least I never attended a “shoot” at
which the gunners steadied their nerves by the
aid of choice vintages—before luncheon, at all
events; and I don’t mean to begin now. Champagne
was probably called “the Boy” because of
its free, happy, joyous, loose-and-careless char­ac­ter­is­tics.
The sparkle represents youth, and the froth
irresponsibility; whilst the
whole&#x2009;<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2015twice.png"
width="265" height="120" alt="――" /> but never
mind about the whole, just now.</p>

<p>The Champagne district, as some people know,
lies on the chalk hills which surround the valley
of the Marne. The townlets of Epernay, Ay,
and Château Thierry owe their prosperity to
these seductive wines, and Rheims has attained
world-wide celebrity, as much from being the
centre of the champagne industry as from being
the seat of the premier ecclesiastic of France,
the Archbishop of Paris. So far, guide-book.</p>

<p>The champagne-vines are short and stunted,
the grapes being small, but most prolific of juice.
A third, and even a fourth, crushing will yield a
very delicious wine, to an uneducated palate; and
this is the inferior liquor which is sold to tourists
in Rheims at the equivalent of one shilling and
fivepence per large bottle. It
is a sweet—what <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
connoisseurs call a “lady’s” wine, which an
expert would not taste a second time; and its
aftermath, its effect on the imbiber the following
day, is somewhat distressing. Somehow, notwithstanding
the import duties, champagne—I
am alluding now to the superior brands—is
almost as cheap in London as in the best hotels
in Rheims; but the experiment of drinking it
in the land of its birth is not as risky as on alien
shores. At least so say the natives of the district,
who maintain that although work in the cellars
is not the pleasantest in the world—the strong
smell, which is even intoxicating, giving the
workmen a distaste for the sparkling wine—it is
quite possible for an outsider to drink a quantity
of champagne of undoubted quality without feeling
any bad after-effects.</p>

<p>“You may, in fact,” it was told me on the
spot, “drink four bottles of Pommery ’84, and
feel all the better for it next day.”</p>

<p>Possibly; but how about the inferior stuff
which we used to sample, occasionally, in our
salad days, when our green judgment led us to
pass our early mornings in riotous junketings in
the now staid and peaceful region of the Haymarket,
S.W.? Much later than those days I
have sampled alleged champagne—“extra <i>sec</i>,” it
was called, though “extra sick” would have
been more appropriate—on a race-course, in
order to fitly celebrate some famous victory.
But in my riper years, the victory (when it
occurs) is honoured in more staid and seemly
fashion. I was never nearer death by poison than
one Friday morning in the ancient
city of York, <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
after indulging somewhat freely in the “sparkling”
proffered me on the previous day in a
booth on Knavesmire. Do what I would—and
I walked ten miles, went for a scull on the river
Ouse, and then swallowed hot mustard-and-water—the
distressing sensations, the great wave of
depression which seemed to have swamped the
heart, would not quit the body, until—and the
idea came as a bolt from the blue—I had summoned
up sufficient strength of mind to enter
the coffee-room of the principal hotel, and
demand a pint of Pommery. It was <i>not</i> a hair
of the dog which had bitten me; the mangy
brute from the attention of whose fangs I was
suffering was no sort of relation to the highly-bred
terrier who rooted out the anguish from my
soul. And that small pint was so successful that
another went the same way. And by that time
I had been inspired with nerve enough to face a
charging tiger, unarmed.</p>

<p>Many learned people, including one section
of the medical profession, incline to the belief
that consumption of champagne offers direct encouragement
to gout. But there is no such
idea amongst those employed in the cellars of
Moet et Chandon, Geisler, Mum, Pommery, and
other large firms. Not that these workmen are
allowed to drink as much of their own foaming
productions as they have a mind to. As a matter
of fact the wine supplied to the <i>ouvriers</i> is the
thin red stuff of the district, resembling inferior
Burgundy, and not of a very elevating nature.
It is not particularly attractive, this life of labour,
for nine or ten hours a day, in
a damp, cold <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
cellar some fifty yards below the level of the
street pavements, with occasionally bottles bursting
to right and left of you. These cellars are
cut out of the calcareous rock, and were, many of
them, inherited from the Romans; and champagne
is such a sensitive, exacting sort of wine
that it must be stored in the very bowels of the
earth, where all is peace and quietude, and where
neither motion nor vibration can reach the
maturing vintages.</p>

<p>At least that is what they tell visitors;
although the only time I have visited champagne
cellars could hardly be called a peaceful experience,
owing to the almost continuous bombardment
of bursting bottles. And it is said that as
a rule at least 10 per cent of the stored wine is
wasted in this way; whilst in seasons of early
and unusual heat the percentage may rise to as
much as 20, and even 25.</p>

<p>Sparkling champagne—and we are not concerned
with the still wine—is the result of a
peculiar treatment during fermentation. During
the winter months the wine is racked-off, and
fined with isinglass; and in the early spring it is
bottled and tightly corked. In order to collect
the sediment in the necks of the bottles these are
placed at first in a sloping condition, with the
corks downward, for a term. In the second
year this sediment requires to be disgorged, or
<i>dégagé</i>-ed. This feat can only be learnt by long
practice, and even then there be workmen who
cannot be safely trusted to shift the sediment,
without shifting a too-large proportion of the
wine itself. <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span></p>

<p>May I confess to the belief that I should never
make a good, reliable, valuable disgorger?</p>

<p>Of course there is art, or knack, in it. The
<i>degager</i> takes a bottle, cuts the string of the cork,
expels the sediment—occasionally without
spilling more than a drop or two—and passes the
bottle to his neighbour, who fills it up with a
liqueur, composed of sugar-candy dissolved in
cognac, and flavoured, and with some bright,
clarified wine. The bottle is then recorked, by
machinery, wired, labelled, and sent about its
business.</p>

<p>The fermentation being incomplete at the
first bottling of the wine, the carbonic acid gas
generated in a confined space—this part comes
unadorned, out of a book—exerts pressure on
itself, and it thus remains as a liquid in the wine.
When this pressure is removed it expands into
gas, and thus communicates the sparkling property
to champagne. Hence the bombardments.</p>

<p>How do I know all this? I once paid a visit
to the cellars of Pommery et C<sup>ie.</sup>&#x202f;; and my
dearest friend asked sub­se­quent­ly what sort of
writ of ejectment had to be drawn up to rid
them of my presence and thirst. But all joking
apart the time was well spent, and the industry
is deserving of all the encouragement which it
receives. The head cellarman is, literally a host
in himself, an old gentleman of aristocratic mien,
and portly—or, rather, champagne-ly—presence;
and one of the <i>formulae</i> to be gone through before
quitting the premises is to drink a glass of the
very best with that charming old gentleman, who
I hope still flourishes amid his
bottles and his <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span>
disgorgers. And when it is added that there are
usually upwards of 15,000,000 bottles in the
cellars at one time, the old heresy as to the
district being unable to supply sufficient wine
save for Russian consumption is at once exploded.</p>

<p>In fact some twenty-five millions of gallons of
champagne are produced, annually, in the district.
Of course not all of it is of the finest growth, and
some of it a connoisseur would reject with scorn.
In order to smash another old fallacy it is,
perhaps, hardly necessary to add that champagne
is <i>not</i> made from gooseberries—at all events in
countries where grapes grow. And the reason
for this is that gooseberry juice is far scarcer,
and therefore more expensive than grape juice.
Some few dozens may be made in England, but
to make sufficient gooseberry champagne to be
profitable would require more berries than are
grown in the country. It would, in fact,
require hundreds of tons of the fruit to pay the
man­u­fac­turer.</p>

<p>Lest my readers should be wearied of the
subject of French wines, I shall not particularize
as to the burgundies, but confine myself to the
clarets of the country which are by far the more
popular wines in England—even when they are
artificially man­u­fac­tured, in Spain, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>“The wines that be made in Bordeaux,”
wrote Gervase Markham, in the middle of the
seventeenth century, “are called Gascoyne wines,
and you shall know them by their hazel hoopes,
and the most be full gadge, and sound wines.”</p>

<p>Evidently adulteration’s artful aid was but
little employed
in those days. <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span></p>

<p>“See that in your choice of Gascoine wines,”
continues Gervase, in his minute direction to the
overwrought “housewife,” “that your Clarret
wines be faire coloured, and bright as a Rubie,
not deepe as an Ametist; for though it may shew
strength, yet it wants neatnesse. If your Clarret
wine be faint, and have lost his color, then
take a fresh hogshead with his fresh lees which
was very good wine, and draw your wine into
the same, then stop it close and tight, and lay it
a foretake for two or three daies that the lees
may run through it, then lay it up till it be fine,
and if the colour be not perfit, draw it into a red
wine hogshead .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if your Clarret wine
have lost his colour, take a pennyworth of
<span class="nowrap">Damsens&#x2009;<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2015twice.png"
width="265" height="120" alt="――" />”</span> ha! what is this?</p>

<p>“Or else blacke Bullesses, as you see cause,
and stew them with some red wine of the deepest
colour, and make thereof a pound or more of
sirrup, and put it into a cleane glasse, and after
into the hogshead of Clarret wine; and the same
you may likewise doe unto red wine if you
please.”</p>

<p><span class="sprghta">Ahem&#x202f;!</span>
Evidently they did know something
about adulteration in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>It is a common idea that only a very few
clarets are entitled to the prefix “Château.” The
truth is very different. The district on the
south bank of the Gironde simply teems with
châteaux, of a kind. For miles you cannot go
a few hundred yards in any direction without
seeing or passing two or three; each with its
vineyards and cellars and special labels, and more
or less unblemished reputation.
There is Château <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
Latour, and there is (or may be) the Château
Smith. Did I choose to buy a cottage in that
district, grow my own grapes, and make my own
wines, I should be fully entitled to label them
“Château Gubbins,” and incur no penalty by so
doing.</p>

<p>But please do not pick the ripe grapes,
although you may be sorely tempted by the
sight of dozens of bunches separated from the
vines by their sheer weight, and lying in the
furrows. Plenty of people do commit this sort
of theft, for there be hundreds of the rough
element who visit the Médoc country. The
“Hooligans” and <i>gamins</i> of Bordeaux drift here
at picking-time just as the poor of London
drift into the county of Kent during the hopping
season. They are not loved, but they have to
be endured. Somebody must pick the grapes,
and after all a few depredations will not ruin the
grower any more than do the strawberry-pickers
in the south of England “break” the growers,
by adopting their usual plan: “three in the
mouth, one in the basket.”</p>

<p>The claret-cellars are not nearly as far
beneath the earth as are those in the region
about Rheims. Nor are they as amusing. There
is no “pop, pop” down here, no danger of wounds
and lacerations from flying splinters of glass.
The principal objects of interest are the cobwebs
which are piled up all over the place like dusky
curtains. It is not well to sample too many
glasses which may be offered you of the wine of
the country. For the samples are taken from
the new, immature wine, and
are suggestive of <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
pains and disturbances below the belt. The
head cellarman, portly and urbane like his
brother of Rheims, will watch your face closely
as you taste his novelties, and will invariably ask
your opinion of it. But the wise visitor will
not be too opinionative on the subject. I have
noticed that the man who says the least is
accounted the most knowing, whether he be
inspecting the contents of a cellar, or of a stable.
And believe me, there is as much rubbish talked
about wine as about horses. Still, in sampling
new champagne you may praise indiscriminately,
without being accounted an absolute dunce;
whilst with claret it is altogether different. The
wine varies exceedingly with the vintage; and
none but an expert and accomplished palate may
dare to say what is good, what is bad, and what
is mediocre.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to state that claret was not
drunk, on ordinary occasions, by the Ancient
Britons? I trow not. And I fancy the wines
of the noble old Romans partook more of the
nature of burgundies than clarets. In England
the wines of Médoc have never been fully
appreciated until during the latter half of the
present century, when the taste for port began
to die out, with the good port itself. And as I
writhe, occasionally, in the throes of gout, I
bethink me of the merciless law delivered unto
Moses, which provides that the sins of the
fathers shall be visited upon their descendants,
even unto the third and fourth generation. For
the good old three-and-four-bottle men of eighty
years ago, and farther back than
that, certainly laid <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
the foundations for much of the trouble at this
end of the century. Still there be doctors who
actually recommend port wine as a gout-fuge.
And it is certainly safer to drink a little good
port—matured in the wood, and innocent of
beeswing—an you be a podagric subject, than
some of the clarets which, thanks to the enterprise
of the late Mr. W. E. Gladstone, are within the
reach of the slenderest purse.</p>

<p>Do not smoke whilst drinking claret, or port,
either. Nothing destroys the flavour of red
wine so effectually as the flavour of a cigar.</p>

<p>One of the greatest “sells” ever experienced
by an expectant party of claret judges—of whom
I posed as one—was after this fashion. Our
host had inherited a pipe of Château Lafitte ’64,
which had been duly bottled off. We had
enjoyed a nice plain little dinner—a bit of
crimped cod, a steak, and a bird—in order the
better to taste the luscious wine. After dinner
bottle number one made its appearance; and as
they sipped, and prepared to sing hymns of
praise, the jaws of the guests fell. And a great
cry uprose: “Pricked&#x202f;!”</p>

<p class="pfirst">On
the decline and fall of port wine volumes
might be written. At the same time I am not
the man who is going to write them. According
to early recollections, the conversation of
my elders was limited to hunting, racing, and
the wines of Oporto. The man who had “&#x202f;’20,”
or “Comet,” port in his cellars was a man to be
cultivated, and dined with; whilst “&#x202f;’34” and
“&#x202f;’47” men were next in demand. And this
was after the era of the three-and-four-bottle
heroes, of whose deeds I have heard my father
speak, almost with bated breath; how, after the
retirement of the ladies, to discuss tea and
scandal by themselves, the dining-room door
would be locked by the host
himself, who would <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
pocket the key thereof. Many of the guests
slept where they fell, “repugnant to command,”
like the sword of Pyrrhus, whilst others would
be fastened in the interior of their chariots at a
later hour. Even in the late fifties, the estimable
divine with whom I was studying the beauties
of the classics, would on the frequent occasion of
a dinner-party provide one bottle of port per
head, for his guests, in addition to hock, champagne,
and sherry; and the writer, then a boy of
fifteen, was included amongst the “heads.”</p>

<p>But as the stone age succeeded the ice age, as
the iron age succeeded the stone age, and as the
gold age, and the railway age, and the rotten
company age succeeded the iron age, so have the
whisky age, and the “small bottle” age, and the
gin-and-bitters age almost wiped out the age
when man drank, talked, and thought port. Our
ancestors were im­mod­er­ate in their potations but,
as far as wine went, these were but rarely indulged
in until after sundown, although the Briton
would frequently wash his breakfast down with
ale of the strongest. And it is difficult to
believe that the evil habit of “nipping,” at all
hours of the day, which now prevails in some
circles—a habit which is mainly due to the
break-neck pace at which life is pursued—is
either more conducive to health or intellectuality,
or morality than the after-dinner debauch of a
century ago.</p>

<p>The “hot and heady” wine is (or, rather,
was) produced chiefly in a mountainous district
of Portugal called Cima de Douro. The wine
is largely mixed with
spirit even during <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
fermentation, the proper colour being given by a
mixture known as <i>jeropiga</i>, which is a preparation
of elder-berries, molasses, raisin juice, and spirit.</p>

<p>The wine which is made within the Metropolitan
Police District, for the special benefit of
landladies, infirmaries, and she-choristers, is also
treated with a similar mixture, with the addition
of a little logwood-extract; but in fashionable
quarters the mixture is not known as <i>jeropiga</i>, a
name which would probably affect the sale.</p>

<p>Port wine was known in England before the
year 1700, but was not in much demand. From
the year mentioned till 1826 the export trade was
a monopoly in the hands of English merchants.
The effect of this monopoly was to increase the
price in England, and to gradually deteriorate
the quality. Exports from Oporto have decreased
in a marked way for the last forty years or so;
and although there is still some demand, and
some decent wine left, the “hot and heady”
concoction whether dry or fruity, a lady’s wine,
or a military ditto, is gradually leaving us.</p>

<p>The pity of <span class="sprghta">it&#x202f;!</span>
And si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly with its
de­par­ture comes the pro­nounce­ment of the
medical pro­fes­sion that port (with the exception
of the “old crusted” brand) does <i>not</i> encourage
gout to abide within the human frame. I may
fairly claim to have been a “port man” all
my life, and never, when serving Her Majesty,
overlooked my orthodox allowance of the
“black strap” purchased with the Prince
Regent’s allowance. Nev­er­the­less I am not
going to recommend this description of wine as
an ideal breakfast drink; although
very early in <span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span>
life I once made trial of it at nine o’clock one
morning.</p>

<p>This was in the good town of Reading, in
company with a schoolmate or two. We were
on our way home for the holidays, and had been
entrusted, for the first part of the journey, to
the care of the French master. Him we had
evaded for the time being—he was much interested
in the man­u­fac­ture of sweet biscuits—and
marching boldly into the best inn’s best room,
we demanded bread and cheese and a bottle of
the most expensive port on the wine-list. Schoolboy-like
our fancy turned to quaintness in the
matter of meals; and I am bound to add that
the state of our health was not one whit improved
by this weird breakfast. As for the French
master, no sooner had he run us to earth,
than&#x2009;<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2015twice.png"
width="265" height="120" alt="――" /> but
that part of the story is too painful to tell.</p>
</div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<p>One of the oldest winter beverages known to
civilization is</p>

<h3><i>Bishop</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">a composition of port wine and spices of which
it has been <span class="nowrap">written:—</span></p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Three cups of this a prudent man may take;</div>
<div class="dpp00">The first of these for constitution’s sake,</div>
<div class="dpp00">The second to the girl he loves the best,</div>
<div class="dpp00">The third and last to lull him to his rest.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">And an effectual luller is this Bishop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make several incisions in the rind of a lemon,
stick cloves in the incisions, and roast the lemon
at a slow fire. Put small but
equal quantities of <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span>
cinnamon, cloves, mace, and all-spice into a saucepan,
with half a pint of water; let it boil until
reduced one-half. Boil one bottle of port wine;
burn a portion of the spirit out of it by applying a
lighted paper to the saucepan. Put the roasted
lemon and spice into the wine, stir it well, and let
it stand near the fire ten minutes. Rub a few
lumps of sugar on the rind of a lemon, put the
sugar into a bowl with the juice of half a lemon
(not roasted), pour the wine into it, grate some
nutmeg into it, sweeten to taste, and serve with the
lemon and spices floating on the surface.</p></blockquote>

<p>To sum up, the decline and fall of port in
British estimation may be said to be due, mainly,
to the following causes: inferiority of most of
the modern vintages, the introduction of whisky,
the present taste for lighter wines, such as the
cheaper clarets and burgundies, with the wines of
Germany and Italy, and a sort of “boom” in
wines from Australia and California. These
last-named, however, are but seldom seen at the
tables of the wealthy; and thus far the demand
for the productions of gallant little Wales have
not been in any great request, although the
demand is said to be equal to the supply.</p>

<p>Sherry, the “sack” which was said to cheer the
heart of Sir John Falstaff and other of Shakespeare’s
heroes, is, like port, a light of other days.
Like the wine of Portugal, also, its exportation has
for many years been in the hands of English settlers.
The following startling statistics have been
published about these exports, which statistics
speak for themselves: The output to England
in 1891 was 2,135,969 gallons,
or <i>sixty-four per
cent</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
less than in 1873, which was the “record”
sherry year. And although many efforts have
been made to stem the ebb, the last seven
years have shewn a steady decrease in the
exports.</p>

<p>Yet, according to the best authorities, sherry
is not only the purest, but the most wholesome of
all wines. Of course, in making this statement
the wine of Spain, the <i>vino de Jerez</i> is implied,
and not the home-made productions for the malefit
of those who study economy without due
regard to digestion. Strictly speaking, sherry
means Jerez (pronounced “herreth”) wine. But
Manzanilla, a wine which is made at St. Lucas,
and Montilla which comes from a town south of
Cordova, may come under the same category.
And with a view of shewing the wholesomeness
of sherry it is stated, by no less an authority than
the <i>Lancet</i>, that it is the only wine enjoined in
the preparations of the wines of the British
Pharmacopœia, with two exceptions—viz. <i>vinum
ferri citratis</i>, and <i>vinum quininae</i>, which are made
with orange wine. Therefore it is certain that
the sufferer from gout, for whom <i>vinum colchici</i>
is prescribed, may swallow a proportion of the
juice of the grape, and, possibly, a hair of the
dog which bit him. This naturally recalls the
old story of the sherry which was sent to a former
Lord Chesterfield as a <i>panacea</i> for his ailment,
and the curt reply sent: “Sir, I have tried your
sherry, and prefer the gout.”</p>

<p>There are several types of sherries, according to
the different characters developed. These are known
by several distinguishing terms <span class="xxpn"
id="p143">{143}</span> comprehending the characters and
specific qualities of the wine from one end to the other
of a scale ranging from delicate and light wines to rich,
generous, and dark-coloured wines. Between a straw-coloured
<i>Vino de Pasto</i> and the very fine Old East India Brown—the
sherry which two decades ago was in enormous demand at
such old-fashioned hostelries as the “Rainbow” in Fleet
Street, ere the reign of gin-and-bitters—there is a
vast difference, both in colour and flavour. Broadly,
however, sherry may be divided into two classes—<i>fino</i>,
a light-coloured, delicate light wine of the Amontillado
type, and the <i>oloroso</i>, a full-bodied, highly-developed
wine.</p>

<p>The sherry grapes are collected and placed in
large panniers on the backs of mules and conveyed
to the press-houses. The press is of very
primitive construction, and is identical with those
used in ancient history. It consists simply of a
wooden trough about ten feet square, provided in
the centre with a screw press, which is used after
the treading by foot power is done, to get the
last drop of juice out of the crushed mass.
Rather less than a ton of grapes serves for one
pressing, and the idea that this is done with the
naked feet of the Spanish peasantry is a popular
error. Sherry is not kneaded like German bread.
Men clad in light clothing and shod with wooden
clogs, with nails on the soles and heels, pointing
in a slanting direction, proceed to tread the
grapes in a most methodical manner, proceeding
row by row, each row being of the width of the
nailed sole of the clog.</p>

<p>After the grapes have been
trodden over for <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
the first time, <i>i.e.</i> partly crushed and bruised, a
measured quantity of sulphate of lime (<i>Yeso</i>)
is sprinkled over the sticky mass—now I have
gone so far perhaps ’twould be as well to complete
the narrative, although it is not always wise
to enquire too closely into the interior economy
of wine presses, or kitchens. This sulphate of
lime is a pure native earth, found in the
neigh­bour­hood of Jerez, and is burnt before being
mixed with the grapes. How many sherry
drinkers, I wonder, know how largely mother
earth enters into their pet tipple? The idea,
certainly, does not seem a nice one, but this
mixing of lime with sherry is a very ancient
custom indeed.</p>

<p>Pliny—where should we modern bookmakers
be without dear old Pliny?—mentions the
custom as an ancient African one. And in
days of yore it must be remembered that Africa
was not entirely populated by cannibals and
dervishes, but was the home of many who lived
wisely and well.</p>

<p>“There’s lime in the sack!” is a sentence put
into the mouth of Falstaff. In modern days
the process has become known as “plastering,”
from the fact that plaster-of-Paris consists
principally of sulphate of lime or burnt gypsum.</p>

<p>“It is interesting,” says the <i>Lancet</i>, “to
surmise the origin of this very ancient custom.
That it had some intelligent basis admits of no
doubt. Some think that it had its origin in the
fact being noticed that when the grape juice was
fermented in alabaster vessels or in marble tanks
the wine was better, it
clarified quicker, and <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
developed character more sat­is­fac­tor­i­ly. Others
regard the addition of sulphate of lime as convenient
from a mechanical point of view during
the pressing; it was necessary when the grapes
were wetter than usual in order to bind the
residuary mass together. We do not incline to
this view.”</p>

<p>As the <i>Lancet</i> devotes a considerable space
to the exposition of the view to which it does
incline I may be excused from quoting it in full—more
especially as there be tables of percentages,
and complicated mathematical calculations in said
exposition. But it is proved to the satisfaction
of the <i>Lancet</i> that “lime in the sack” is matter
in the right place. And although to an uneducated
mind lime suggests such terrifying developments
of <i>tarda podagra</i> as chalk-stones, possibly
the action of the grapes on the lime renders it
innocuous.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that sherry in keeping
develops a slight increase of alcohol as the time
advances. All spirit added to sherry, however,
is obtained from wine itself, corn-spirit in Spain
being quite a superfluity, since wine-spirit can be
produced so cheaply and in unlimited quantity.
Moreover the importation of German spirit into
Spain is made practically impossible by a prohibitive
duty. Still, unless rumour lies, some
Spanish wines receive the German spirit after
exportation; so Spain “gets there just the
same.”</p>

<p>Here is an item of news which should inspire
confidence in the sceptic.</p>

<p>“Good brandy—<i>i.e.</i>
a genuine wine-distilled <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
spirit—is being produced in Spain in commercial
quantities which it is to be hoped will successfully
compete with the stuff erroneously called
brandy, not to say Cognac, but of which not a
drop has been derived from the grape.”</p>

<p>In my researches into the man­u­fac­ture of
port and sherry, I have come across no mention
of the phylloxera. I am, therefore, halting
between the beliefs, either that the Spaniards
and Portuguese understand vermin better than
do the French, or that the “vine-louse” has
her own reasons for keeping out of Spain and
Portugal.</p>

<p>Forty years ago an estimable Irish nobleman
was known as “Old Sherry,” from his partiality
to that wine. And thirty years ago I was once
seated at the table of a General of Division, up at
Simla. My right-hand neighbour was a son of
this same nobleman, but our host, apparently,
did not know this—or had forgotten the fact.
At all events, during a lull in the conversation,
the General (who had a voice like sharpening a
saw) rapped out: “By the way, Captains—you
say you’ve been quartered in Ireland—did you
ever meet ‘Old Sherry’ there?”</p>

<p>A subaltern can’t very well throw a dinner-roll
at a General or stick a carving-fork into his
leg; but that is what I, personally, felt like
doing.</p>

<p>In mediæval times a sufficient quantity of
wine for the needs of the inhabitants was made
in gallant little Wales; and the idea of reviving
the industry occurred to the Marquis of Bute,
who has done so much for the
welfare of Cardiff <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
and the neigh­bour­hood. The vineyards are on
the site of the old ones, facing south, and the
vines were planted twenty years ago, and are
very hardy. There is no reason why they should
not be propagated to almost any extent, and
there is abundant scope for the extension of the
vineyards and a proportionate increase in the
yield of wine.</p>

<p>The vintages of 1885, 1890, and 1891 are
marked in Messrs. Hatch, Mansfield and Co.’s
list as “All sold,” and although the vintage of
’98, owing to the long spell of dry weather, does
not promise particularly well, the Marquis is no
more unfortunate in this respect than most other
vine-growers.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Vintages.</i></h3>

<p>As my readers may not all be connoisseurs in
the matter of wines, a few words on the subject
of vintages may be appropriate, at the close of
this chapter.</p>

<p>With regard to cham­pagnes, the good years
are ’65, ’68, ’74 (especially good), ’78, ’80, ’84,
’85, ’87 (some­what light in body), ’89, ’92, and
’93. All the other vin­tages since ’65 have
turned out more or less badly; and there have
been no good vin­tages since ’93.</p>

<p>One of the largest and best vintages of claret
on record is that of ’75, which ranks with the
older ones of ’48, ’58, and ’64. ’77 is fair, and
between that year and ’88 there was no vintage
of particular merit. ’93 wine is good, and this
year furnished the largest yield since ’75. ’94
wine is exceptionally bad. During
the five years <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
from ’82 to ’86 the merits of the wines were
completely destroyed by mildew.</p>

<p>The burgundy vintages have been good since
’84. As for ports, the drinkable wines (since
’34) are those of ’41, ’47 (one of the finest wines
ever known), ’51 (exceptionally good), ’52, ’53
(fine and fruity), ’54, ’58, ’63, ’68, ’70, ’72, ’75,
’78 (exceptionally fine), ’81, ’84, ’87 (the best
since ’78), and ’96 which “shews promise.”
The worst years are ’55, ’56, ’57, ’59, ’64, ’66,
’69, ’71, ’74, ’76, ’77, ’79, ’80, ’82, ’83, ’86, ’88,
’91, ’93 (exceptionally bad), ’94, and ’95.</p>

<p>The above statistics are also from Messrs.
Hatch, Mansfield and Co.’s list.</p>

<span class="hsmall">THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT</span></h2>

The Long Drink — Cremorne Gardens — Hatfield — Assorted cocktails — Brandy-and-Soda — Otherwise
Stone Fence — Bull’s
milk — A burglar’s brew — More cocktails — A “swizzle” — L’Amour
Poussée — A corpse reviver — A golden slipper — A
heap of comfort.</div>

<p class="pcontinue">Our
grandfathers knew not the Long Drink;
the chief reason for this fact being that aërated
water, and consequently large tumblers, had not
been invented. And soda-water—one of the most
ineffectual restoratives I know—was originally
employed, under its pet name “sober water,” as
a pick-me-up. The Long Drink came in, I
fancy, with Cremorne. At primæval Vauxhall
men still refreshed themselves with glasses of
alleged sherry, and with rummers of brandy-and-water—a
flat, stale, and unprofitable potion, which
nobody who is in complete possession of his
faculties thinks of imbibing nowadays.</p>

<p>Let us now run over a few recipes which
require large tumblers to hold the drinks. And
we will commence with “cobblers,” those seductive
warm-weather importations from the United
States. <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span></p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Catawba Cobbler</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">so called because Catawba (which is a Californian
wine and but little known in this island of ours)
is seldom used in its concoction. Champagne is
an excellent substitute, whilst a cheaper one is
the Italian wine, sparkling Asti.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Dissolve one teaspoonful of sifted sugar in one
tablespoonful of water in a tumbler; add two glasses
of Catawba, or Asti, or champagne, and fill the
tumbler with crushed ice. Shake, ornament with a
slice of orange or pine-apple, and drink through
straws.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Moselle Cobbler.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>One glass of sparkling moselle in a large
tumbler, a spot of old brandy, sugar to taste, a slice
of lemon, and filled up with crushed ice.</p></blockquote>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>But there is a sameness in the man­u­fac­ture
of cobblers, in which almost every known wine,
or strong water, may be used, with the other
ingredients, ice, sugar, slices of lemon or orange,
and water (not much water) added.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>“The secret of making</p>

<h3>“<i>Hatfield</i>,”</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">writes an invaluable authority, “is supposed to
be a secret only known to the manager at The
Oval. We used to drink at the Old Winchester
Music Hall an imitation, composed of two bottles
of soda-water to one ginger-beer, a quartern of Old
Tom and a half-quartern of noyeau, duly iced.”</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>Most “cocktails” come under
the heading of <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span>
“Short Drinks,” and will be found duly scheduled,
farther on. Here, however, is a long ’un.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Saratoga Cocktail.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Put into a large tumbler twenty drops of pine-apple
syrup, twelve of Angostura bitters, twenty of
maraschino, and a wine-glass of old brandy; nearly
fill the glass with pounded ice, and mix well.

lemon-peel, and top up with champagne.</p></blockquote>

What am I thinking about? This con­coction
is also known in America as “Stone Wall”
(Why?), and used to be known in Her Majesty’s
dominions in Asia as a “Peg”—simply because
every dose swallowed was said to represent a
peg in the coffin being man­u­fac­tured for the
swallower. It is unneces­sary to give any recipe
for this mixture, the proportion of the ingredients
varying with the inclination, disposition, indis­po­si­tion,
state of health, or pocket, of the
swallower. But above all let your ingredients
be of the best. There is only
one thing worse <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
than bad brandy, and that is bad soda-water.
Avoid the cheap stuff with the little glass
stoppers, as you would the tipstaff.</p>

</div></div></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>Although the mint julep is compounded and used
principally in the continent of America, the original
“julap” is a Persian word, signifying a sweet potion. John
Quincey, the author of a dictionary on Physic, describes
julap as “an extemporaneous form of medicine, made of
simple and compound water, sweetened, and serves for a
vehicle to other forms not so convenient to take alone.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span></p>

<p>The simple water is usually omitted nowadays.
And here is one recipe for a Mint Julep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pound a quantity of ice quite fine, enough to
half fill a large tumbler. Add two teaspoonfuls of
sugar. Then add a wine-glass of old brandy, half
a wine-glass of old rum, and two or three sprigs of
mint. Stir well together, and drink through a
straw.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Put into a large tumbler two and a half tablespoonfuls
of water, a tablespoonful of sugar, and two
or three sprigs of mint pressed well into the sugar-and-water
to extract the flavour; add one and a
half wine-glassfuls of brandy, fill up with crushed
ice, shake well, draw the sprigs of mint to the top
of the glass with the stems downwards, and decorate
with berries in season and small slices of orange;
dust with a little sugar, and dash with rum. Serve
with a straw.</p></blockquote>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>Mint julep, it may be added, is supposed to
have been introduced into England by Captain
Marryat, the nautical novelist.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Pine-apple Julep.</i></h3>

<p>This is a beverage for book­makers and company-pro­mot­ers

pine-apple syrup from the tin for the slice of
pine-apple.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<h3><i>A Burglar’s Brew.</i></h3>

<p>Amongst the kind and generous cor­re­spon­dents
who have furnished me with matter for this
work is an Austrian gentleman, who, apparently,
holds some appointment under Government. He
writes: “Our local man in blue (or rather in
<i>green</i>, in Prussia) and I have just driven twenty
miles a burglar to the police-station. Bobby
and I being both new to this part of the world,
did not know the road, but our passenger directed
us quite well, and actually rang the bell himself
at the gaol; after which he most properly wished
a very happy new year to the head constable,
with whom he seemed to be quite on sitting
terms.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>“But the point of this is to tell you of a very
decent drink, mixed by ‘Billy’&#x202f;”—presumably the
burglar—“himself, on our journey—a most acceptable
‘gargle,’ with two feet of snow and a beastly east wind.

<p>“I am afraid the poor fellow won’t get another
taste of it for five years.”</p>

<p>Lager beer and “rhum” does not read particularly
delectable. But there is no accounting
for tastes; and possibly the Burglar’s Brew may
find favour amongst some of my young friends.</p>

subject of long drinks, I will now touch upon a
short one or two. <i>Imprimis</i>,</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Cocktails</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">another brand of beverages which our American
cousins have introduced into the old country. I
am bound to add that the beverage in question
has not altogether “frozen on” here, although
the American Bar has become an institution in
all fashionable and much-frequented quarters.
In the land of its birth the cocktail is said to be
popular at shooting or fishing parties. But on this
side the host who wants his guests to shoot straight
does not ply them freely with fancy drinks.</p>

thought as to how they were to procure what he
wanted, one of them, having procured some
prairie hens’ eggs, not far from the camp, broke
one, and putting the yolk into a glass, sprinkled
it with a little salt and pepper, adding a little

<span class="hsmall">“APPLE SASS”</span></h2>

<div class="depigraph">
Ancient British seider — Conducive to longevity — The best made
in Normandy — Which develops into champagne — And other
popular and salubrious wines — Non-alcoholic cider — A loathsome
brew — German man­u­fac­turers — Medical properties of
apple juice — Away with mel­an­choly — The mill and the
press — Pure wine — Norfolk cider — Gaymer’s gout-fuge — Revival
of the industry — Old process of cider-making — Improving
the flavour — Boiled cider — Hippocras — Juniper
cider — An ancient cider-cup.</div>

<p class="pfirst">According to some chroniclers the ancient
Britons made cider—or “seider” as the poor
ignoramuses wrote it—but it must have been nasty
stuff according to our civilized ideas; for until
the Romans came to visit us the apple was not
cultivated in Britain, nor, indeed, any fruit or
vegetable. Our blue forefathers were not particular
as to what they ate or drank; and I
should think the fermented juice of wild or
“crab” apples must have corroded the throats
of the hardiest.</p>

<p>It is claimed for cider, and perry, that no
fermented drinks do less hurt to the imbiber;
although one authority states that
the man who <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
drinks too much of either invariably falls on the
back of his head, which sounds rather dangerous.
Whether the drinking of cider in moderation
conduces to long life deponent sayeth not; but
no less an authority than Lord Bacon evidently
thought so; and in his <i>History of Life and
Death</i> he tells of eight men dancing a Morris-dance,
whose ages, added together, were 800
years, “tennants of one Mannour” belonging to
the Earl of Essex, and habitual cider-drinkers.
But the lengthening of the days of the imbiber
depends, in all probability, upon the brand of
cider. I have tasted some varieties which were
capable, apparently, of shortening life, rather than
of prolonging it; and in parts of Somersetshire,
even at the present day, the locals—case-hardened
and poison-proof to a man—swill a horrible
decoction, which would probably kill off an alien,
at long range, most speedily and effectively.</p>

<p>Cider was called “cidre” and “sithere” by
fourteenth century writers; and the word is said
to be a corruption of the Greek <i>sikera</i>, used in
the Septuagint to translate the Hebrew <i>shekar</i>,
usually rendered “strong drink” in the Old
Testament.</p>

<p>“The name of <i>Cider</i>,” says one of these old
writers, “if from <i>Sikera</i>, is but a general name
for an inebriating or an intoxicating drink, and
may argue their ignorance in those times of any
other name than <i>Wine</i> for that liquor or juice in
the Saxon or Norman language, either of those
nations being unwilling (it’s probable) to use a
British name for so pleasing a drink, they not
affecting the Britains, made use of
few of their <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span>
words; but since that, that wines have been
imported from foreign parts in great quantities,
the English have been forced to make use of the
old British name
<span class="smcap">S<b>EIDER,</b></span> or <i>Cider</i>, for distinction
sake, although the name <i>vinum</i> may be as proper
for the juice of the apple as the grape, if it be
derived either from <i>Vi</i> or <i>Vincendo</i>, or <i>quasi
Divinum</i>, as one would have it. Also the vulgar
tradition of the scarcity of foreign wines in
England, viz. that Sack, which was then
imported for the most part but from Spain, was
sold in the apothecaries’ shops as a cordial
medicine; and the vast increase in vineyards in
France (Ale and Beer being usual drinks in Spain
and France in Pliny’s time) is an argument sufficient
that the name of <i>Wine</i>, might be attributed to
our British <i>Cider</i>, and of vineyards to the places
separated for the propagating the fruit that
yields it.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the best cider in the
world is made in Normandy. And for what
purpose do the Normans make it? To send
to the Champagne country to be sold to the
unsuspecting tourist as the sparkling wine of that
district. This is solid truth. Hundreds of
millions of gallons are made in Normandy with
the most scrupulous care, under the supervision
of experienced chemists, and the bulk is eventually
sold as champagne. And not only champagne,
but claret, white wines, and even honest,
manly, beautiful, unsophisticated, good old
Portuguese port, owe their being in some instances
to Normandy apples; the rich colour of
the port being added
by log-wood, beet-juice, <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span>
and the root of the rhatany. In fact, genuine
port can be so closely imitated as to deceive
many a good judge; and it really seems wonderful
that the British farmer does not go in for
making port wine, with apples so plentiful and
cheap, and beet, mangels, and elderberries so
easy to cultivate. In fact, given the time, and
the materials, I am convinced that I could produce
an excellent ’98 wine for laying down, for
hospital purposes, public rejoicings, or <i>miladi’s
boudoir</i>.</p>

<p>Cider, like all other useful drinks, can be, and
is, imitated; and Bands of Hope and other
well-meaning but misguided associations are
chiefly responsible for this. What is known
at Sunday-school treats and Salvation Army
marriage-feasts as “non-alcoholic cider” has been
found, on analysis, to be “a water solution of
sugar and citric acid, flavoured with apple
essence.” It’s the flavouring as does it.</p>

<p>“Harvest cider,” as home-made for the
“hands,” is dreadful stuff, and absolutely unfit
for human consumption. Apples which have
fallen of themselves, or been blown off the trees,
“windfalls,” are left on the ground to rot, and
be eaten of slugs and wasps; and are then
shovelled into the cider-mill, together with
leaves, stalks, slugs, wasps, dirt of all sorts,
spiders, ear-wigs, wire-worms, “Daddy Long-legs”-es,
and—other things; the whole being
converted into a species of “hell-broth,” which
would have done credit to the best efforts of the
witches in <i>Macbeth</i>, when properly mixed.</p>

<p>For a long time the Germans
held aloof from <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
the man­u­fac­ture of cider. The good Rhine
wine, and the flowing and flatulent lager of their
own country, were good enough for the Teutonic
palate. But when it comes to a question of
making money, with the risk reduced to a
minimum, Germany seldom “gets left,” as
the Yankees say. Some of the inhabitants of
the Fatherland discovered, about two decades
ago, that there was <i>gelt</i> in cider, and since that
time apples have been imported from France, by
train-loads, for the purpose of being converted
into cider. Germany now exports nearly twelve
times as much of this fascinating beverage as
does France; and under whatever name it may
figure in the bills—German Champagne, Military
Port, Äpfel-wein, or Sparkling Hock—away
goes the apple juice to all parts of the civilized
world, including Damascus, Pekin, Khartoum,
San Francisco, and Shaftesbury Avenue. In
Frankfort-on-the-Maine alone there are more
than fifty cider-factories, and the industry brings
the town at least half a million sterling per annum.</p>

<p>“The fruits of the earth,” says the ancient
chronicler quoted above, “and especially of trees,
were the first food ordained for man to eat.”</p>

<p>And yet I had always understood that it was
for eating an apple that our first parents were
evicted from the garden. But to continue the
quotation.</p>

<p>“And by eating of which (before flesh became
his meat) he lived to a far greater age than since
any have been observed to have lived. And of all
the fruits our Northern parts produce, there’s none
more edible, nor more
wholesome than <i>Apples</i>; <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
which by the various preparations of the cook are
become a part of our table entertainment almost
throughout the year, and are esteem’d to be very
temperate and nourishing.</p>

<p>“They relax the belly, which is a very good
property in them; but the sweet more than the
sharp. They help concoction, eaten after meat,
with a little bread: you may be confident that
an apple eaten after supper”—paste this in your
hats, ye revellers—“depresseth all offensive
vapours that otherwise would offend the head,
and hinder sleep. Apples rosted, scalded, or
otherwise prepared, according to the skill of the
operatour, are good in many hot diseases, against
<i>Melancholy</i>, and the <i>Pleurisie</i>.</p>

<p>“But <i>Cider</i> is much to be preferr’d, it being
the more pure and active part separated from the
impure and feculent; and without all, peradventure,
is the most wholesome drink that is made
in Europe for our ordinary use, as before is
observed. For its specifick vertues, there is not
any drink more effectual against the <i>Scurvy</i>. It
is also prevalent against the <i>Stone</i>, and by its
mundifying qualities is good against the diseases
of the <i>Spleen</i>, and is esteem’d excellent against
<i>Melancholy</i>.”</p>

<p>Possibly the course of time has made us merrier than
our forbears; at all events “mel­an­choly” is a disease for
which no remedy is prescribed in the modern editions of the
Pharmacopœia. What with musical farces, and Arthur Roberts,
and the means to purchase a “livener” next morning, no
citizen of London is justified in the possession of lowness
of spirits. <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span></p>

<p>Making cider is easy enough, but requires,
like all other man­u­fac­tures, care and a modicum
of common sense. And here let me join issue
with those who maintain that the inferiority of
English cider is due to the antiquated methods
employed in making it. In the first place I
question the inferiority; and in the second,
although it is a fact that there is very little
difference between the methods of to-day and
two hundred years ago, we are more careful, on
the whole, in the selection of the material. Far
more important than complicated machinery is
the proper choice of apples. Grow these in a
scientific way, and do not eat all the best for
dessert. The cider apple should be neither green
nor over-ripe—and certainly not rotten like those
used occasionally for the harvesters—free from
injury (and therefore not a “windfall”) and just
full ripe. The selected fruit should be placed in
a mill which breaks them up and pulps them;
the pulp is then put under a press, and squeezed
dry to the last drop. The liquid is then left to
ferment, and this process should be very gradual,
and be closely watched. Finally the cider is
drawn off, the finest qualities being bottled, and
they may be regarded as pure wine. At all
events they are frequently sold “as sich.”</p>

<p>It is claimed that cider, when pure and well
made, is not merely an extremely wholesome
drink, but a very helpful one to those who suffer
from gout or rheumatism. It is asserted that
cider will even cure these painful disorders, and
that those who drink the juice of the apple are
far less subject to aching joints
and limbs than <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span>
other quaffers. It is the “malic acid” in the
liquor which is so inimical to these diseases; and
as a cider-drinker of considerable experience, and
a sad sufferer, at times, from both diseases, I can
safely say that there is no “touch” of either in
the “natural” Norfolk cider made by Messrs.
Gaymer—a dry wine which is very palatable, and
is one of the best and the most wholesome of
beverages.</p>

<p>Cider at its strongest does not contain a large
percentage of alcohol, and its makers contend
that its qualities are more health-giving and far
less heady than those of any other liquor con­sumed
in England. Ac­cord­ing to Mr. Rad­cliffe
Cooke, an enthusiast on the subject, the revival
in the cider industry dates from 1890, and there
is every hope that that industry will flourish more
and more, through the centuries. The recognized
cider fruit may be divided into “bitter-sweets”—such
as the so-called Norman apples
and the Wildings—and the “red” fruits, such as
the nearly extinct “Red Streak.” The best
cider is made from an admixture of the two sorts.
But the gout-fuge cider, we gather from another
writer, should be made from a <i>single</i> sort
of apple.</p>

<p>“There is no difficulty,” writes Mr. Cooke,
“in expressing the apple juice; but the fermentation
process is not sufficiently studied, and it is
here that failure commonly occurs.”</p>

<p>“As for the making of Perry and Cider,”
writes an authority of the seventeenth century,
“which are drinkes much used in the West parts,
and other countries well stored with
fruit in this <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
kingdome; you shall know that your perry is
made of peares onely, and your cider of apples;
and for the manner of making thereof, it is done
after one fashion, that is to say, after your Peares
and Apples are well prickt from the stalkes,
rottennesse, and all manner of other filthe, you
shall put them in the presse mill which is made
with a mil-stone running round in a circle,
under which you shall crush your peares or
apples, and then straining them through a bagge
of haire cloth, tunne up the same (after it hath
bene a little setled) into hogs-heads, barrels, and
other close vessels.</p>

<p>“Now after you have prest all, you shall save
that which is within the haire cloth bagge, and
putting it into severall vessels, put a pretty
quantity of water thereinto, and after it hath
stood a day or two, and hath beene well stirred
together, presse it over also againe, for this will
make a small perry or cider, and must be
spent first. Now of your best cider that which
you make of your summer or sweete fruit you
shall call summer or sweete cider or perry, and that
you shall spend first also; and that which you
make of the winter and hard fruit, you shall call
winter and sowre cider, or perry; and that you
may spend last, for it will indure the longest.”</p>

<p>We don’t boil much cider nowadays, but this
was a custom in con­sid­er­able favour with the
ancients.</p>

<p>“In many places,” says another writer, “they
boyl their cider, adding thereto several spices,
which makes it very pleasant, and abates the
unsavoury smack it contracts
by boyling, but <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{183}</span>
withal gives it a high colour. This way is not
to be commended, because the juice of the apple
is either apt to extract some ill savour from the
brass or copper, we being not acquainted with
any other vessels to boyl it in, or the sediment
of it is apt to burn by its adhering to the sides
of the vessel, it being boyl’d in a naked fire.</p>

<p>“But if you are willing to boyl your cider,
your vessel ought to be of <i>Latten</i>, which may be
made large enough to boyl a good quantity, the
<i>Tin</i> yielding no bad tincture to the liquor. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
It many times happens that cider that hath been
good, by ill-management or other accident
becomes dead, flat, sowr, thick, muddy, or musty;
all which in some sort or other may be cured.
You may cure deadness or flatness in cider by
grinding a small parcel of apples, and putting
them in at the bung-hole, and stopping it close,
only sometimes trying it by opening the small
vent that it force not the vessel; but then you
must draw it off in a few days, either into bottles
or another vessel, lest the <i>Murc</i> corrupt the
whole mass. Cider that is dead or flat will
oftentimes revive again of itself, if close stopt,
upon the revolution of the year and approaching
summer.”</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Hippocras.</i></h3>

<p>Here is an ancient <span class="nowrap">recipe:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take of cardamoms, carpobalsamum, of each half
an ounce, coriander-seeds prepared, nutmegs, ginger,
of each two ounces, cloves two drachms; bruise and
infuse them two days in two gallons of the richest
sweetest cider, often stirring it
together, then add <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
thereto of milk three pints, strain all through an
hippocras bag, and sweeten it with a pound of sugar-candy.</p></blockquote>

<p>D’you kna-ow—as the curate in <i>The Private
Secretary</i> says—I am not taking any hippocras
to-day.</p>

<p>“Wormwood imbib’d in cider,” says another
writer, “produceth the effect that it doth in
wine.” Evidently some nasty effect; only conceive
an admixture of absinthe and cider!</p>

<p>That the ancients loved mixtures—and sweet
mixtures—is pretty evident from the writings of
Pliny and others. Were a man to invite me to
drink apple juice in the which had been bottled
dried juniper-berries, I should probably hit that
man in the eye, or send for a policeman. But
two or three hundred years ago “juniper-cider”
appears to have been a popular drink, although
we read that “the taste thereof is somewhat
strange, which by use will be much abated.”</p>

<p>Ginger, cloves, cinnamon, currants, honey,
rosemary, raspberries, blackberries, elderberries,
and “clove-July-flowers,” all used to be put into
cider, by way of flavouring; “but the best addition,”
says the same writer, “that can be to it
is that of the lees of <i>Malaga</i> Sack or Canary new
and sweet, about a gallon to a hogshead; this is
a great improver and a purifier of cider.”</p>

<p>Evidently in those days they had some crude
sort of ideas on the subject
of Cider Cup.</p></div><!--section-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p class="pfirst">Let us commence with that grand old British
eye-opener,</p>

<h3><i>Cherry Brandy.</i></h3>

<p>There are more ways than one of making
this. Here is an old recipe.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Take six dozen pounds of cherries, half red and
half black, and mash or squeeze them with your
hands to pieces, and put to them three gallons of
brandy, and let them stand steeping twenty-four
hours. Then put the mash’d cherries and liquor a
little at a time into a canvas bag, and press it as
long as any juice will run; sweeten it to your taste,
and put it into a vessel fit for it, and let
it stand a <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
month, and bottle it out; put a lump of loaf-sugar
into every bottle.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another way, and a nicer; the idea of squeezing
cherries to pieces with the human hands
savouring of barbarism—and fingers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take Black Geans or Black Morellos—but
remember that the former are sweet, the latter acid
and bitter, and there will be a great difference in
the results. They must not be over-ripe. Take
off the stalks, and if you choose prick them with
a pin. Fill a bottle with them three-quarters, pour
in brandy to the neck, and cork it up. It will be
ready in a month.</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noticed that no mention of sugar is
made in the above. The necessary quantity
would naturally vary, according to the description
of cherry employed.</p>

<p>Yet another—my way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This can either be made from Black Gean cherries,
or Morellos, but the latter are better for the purpose.
Every pound of cherries will require one quarter of
a pound of white sugar and one pint of the best
brandy. The cherries, with the sugar well-mixed
with them, should be placed in wide-mouthed bottles,
filled up with brandy; and if the fruit be previously
pricked, the mixture will be ready in a month. But
a better blend is procured if the cherries are
untouched, and this principle holds good with all
fruit treated in this way, and left corked for at least
three months.</p></blockquote>

<p>It should be borne in mind that these cordials
are far better
when home-made—provided always <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
the best materials be used. The cherry brandy,
sloe gin, etc. etc., which is bought is not always
made with ’65 cognac. Remember how many
people have to make some sort of profit out of
what can be purchased over the counter.</p>

<p>One more way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put six pounds of black cherries, six pounds of
Morellos, and two pounds of strawberries in a cask.
Bruise them slightly with a stick, then add three
pounds of sugar, twelve cloves, half an ounce of
powdered cinnamon, and two grated nutmegs, with
a quarter of the kernels of the cherry-stones, and a
handful of mint and balm. Pour over these six
quarts of brandy, and let the cask remain open for
ten days. Then close it, and in two months it will
be fit for use.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Cherry Gin</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">can be made in the same way as any of the
above, merely substituting Old Tom for cognac.
And if you want to make it extra good, use
sugar-candy instead of the ordinary “best lump.”</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Cherry Whisky</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">was introduced to the public at the Brewers’
Exhibition in the Royal Agri­cul­tural Hall,
London, in 1898. I have not tasted it, but
suppose that the method of making it is similar
to any of the above recipes, sub­sti­tut­ing Glen­livet.
But I fancy brandy or gin would always be
preferable; for whisky does not blend well with
fruit. <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span></p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Sloe Gin.</i></h3>

<p>The difference between this cordial as made
at home, and allowed to mature gradually, and
the stuff retailed in taverns, is marked. ’Tis a
“refresher” which has only become popular
within the last few years; and consequently
within a radius of twenty miles from London,
the sloe-bushes are stripped of their fruit, before
it is fit to pick, by the poorer classes, who can
obtain sixpence per pound—or something like
that price—for sloes in the market. But the sloe
should not be picked for this purpose until it has
experienced at least one night’s frost.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Allow one pound of sugar to one pound of sloes.
Half fill an ordinary quart bottle with sugared sloes,
and fill up with gin. If the sloes have been
previously pricked, the liqueur will be fit for use in
a couple of months; but ’tis better <i>not</i> to prick
them, but let the gin do its own work of extraction.
In that case the bottle should not be uncorked
within twelve months.</p></blockquote>

<p>A great deal of the alleged sloe gin sold is
light in colour, and has evidently been hurried in
its preparation. A great deal more is quite
innocent of sloe juice, and is merely inferior gin,
diluted and coloured. The orthodox sloe gin
should bear the hue of “fruity” port wine. See
that you get it.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Highland Cordial.</i></h3>

<p>Here is another recipe into which the wine
of bonnie Scotland enters. At
one time the <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
cordial was popular with the Scots, who now,
however, prefer their whisky unadorned.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Steep in one bottle of old Scotch whisky one
pint of white currants, stripped of their stalks, the
thin rind of a lemon, and one teaspoonful of essence
of ginger. Let the mixture stand for forty-eight
hours, and then strain through a hair sieve. Add
one pound of loaf-sugar, which will take at least a
day to thoroughly dissolve. Then bottle off and
cork well. It will be ready for use in three months,
but will keep longer.</p></blockquote>

<p>A cordial which is but seldom asked for
nowadays was known in the seventeenth century
as</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>King Charles II.’s Surfeit-Water</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take a gallon of the best aqua-vitæ, and a
quart of brandy, and a quart of anniseed-water, a
pint of poppy-water, and a pint of damask-rose-water;
put these in a large glass jar, and put to it
a pound of fine powdered sugar, a pound and a half
of raisins stoned, a quarter of a pound of dates stoned
and sliced, one ounce of cinnamon bruised, cloves
one ounce, four nutmegs bruised, one stick of
licorice scraped and sliced; let all these stand nine
days close covered, stirring three or four times a
day; then add to it three pounds of fresh poppies,
or three handfuls of dried poppies, a sprig of angelica,
two or three of balm; so let it stand a week longer,
then strain it out and bottle it.</p></blockquote>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>And then notify the undertaker, I should
think. The Merry Monarch had his faults,
but, surfeit or no surfeit, it is hard to believe
that a king could bring himself to
lap such a <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
“hell-broth” as the above. Pah! Let us take
the taste out with</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Ginger Brandy</i>.</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Bruise slightly two pounds of black currants,
and mix them with one ounce and a half of ground
ginger. Pour over them one bottle and a half of
best old brandy, and let the mixture stand for two
days. Strain off the liquid, and add one pound of
loaf-sugar which has been boiled to a syrup in a
little water. Bottle and cork closely.</p></blockquote>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Orange-flower Brandy.</i></h3>

<p>There is not much of this in the market, or
the store-cupboard.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Take a gallon of best brandy, and mix with it a
pound of orange-flowers which have been boiled.
Save the water, sweeten it, and bottle off the
mixture.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Carraway Brandy.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Steep an ounce of carraway seeds and six ounces
of loaf-sugar in a quart of brandy. Let this stand
nine days, then strain and bottle.</p></blockquote>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>And the author of the above adds: “&#x202f;’Tis
a good cordial.” Three hundred years ago
carraways invariably figured at the dessert-table
in England. The seeds now appear either in
cakes for school-treats, sugar-plums, or the
favourite liqueur known as</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Kümmel</i>.</h3>

<p>This is principally made in Russia, and is
an excellent stomachic. Own
brother to the <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
carraway seed is the anise seed, which appears in
a liqueur, made chiefly at Bordeaux, and called</p>

<h3><i>Anisette</i>.</h3>

<p>Personally, I prefer Kümmel, and the other
is more of a drug than an enlivening potion.
Cough remedies for the most part contain anise
seed, which is also largely used at a “drag”
hunt, hounds being especially keen on the scent.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Apricot Brandy.</i></h3>

<p>This is not often met with away from its
home in the United States.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>To every pound of fruit (which should not be
quite ripe) add one pound of loaf-sugar. Put the
apricots into a preserving-pan, with sufficient water
to cover them. Let them boil up, and then simmer
gently until tender. Remove the skins. Clarify and
boil the sugar, then pour it over the fruit, and let it
remain twenty-four hours. Then put the apricots
into wide-mouthed bottles, and fill them up with
syrup and brandy, half and half. Cork tightly, and
seal the tops of the corks.</p></blockquote>

<p>This apricot brandy should be prepared in the
month of July, and kept at least twelve months
before using.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Quince Whisky.</i></h3>

<p>I once superintended the brew of a decoction
of quinces and Scotch whisky. The quinces
were treated exactly as the apricots are in the

<h3><i>Orange Brandy</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">should be made in the month of March, and,
well-made, is the best of all cordials, being
especially valuable on a cold morning just before
proceeding with the hounds to draw Newton
Wood.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Take the thin rinds of six Seville oranges, and
put them into a stone jar, with half a pint of the
strained juice and half a gallon of good old brandy.
Let it remain three days, then add one pound and
a quarter of loaf-sugar—broken, not pounded—and
stir till the sugar is dissolved. Let the liquor stand
a day, strain it through paper until quite clear, pour
into bottles, and cork tightly. The longer it is kept
the better.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ancients apparently interpreted the word
“cordial” in a different way to our later way;
and their cordials were chiefly used in the sick-room.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>The Saffron Cordial</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">for instance, was chiefly employed to cure fainting
fits, the ague, and the smallpox. I think I
should have preferred all three complaints at
once.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Fill a large still with marigold flowers, and strew
on it an ounce of ground nut­meg; beat them

three pints of mus­ca­dine or tent, or Malaga sack,
and with a sprig of rose­mary dash it on the flowers;
then distil it off with a slow fire, and let
it drop on <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span>
white sugar-candy; draw it off till it begins to be
sowre, save a pint of the first running to mix with
other waters on an extra­or­di­nary occasion; mix the
rest together to drink by itself. Take five or six
spoon­fuls at a time.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Curaçoa</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">is not only the best known of all
liqueurs, but the most wholesome. It will blend equally
well with brandy and whisky. The best, in fact the original
brand, is made in Amsterdam, with the peel of a very rare
orange which grows in the island of Curaçoa, and falls from
the tree before it is ripe. The peel of this is dried,
and is known in the trade as the Curaçoa of Holland, to
distinguish it from other Curaçoas which have not the
same property, although they are often sold in place of
it. The Dutch distillers naturally keep their process a
secret, but the French imitators declare that the Dutch
secret is merely as follows: that five kilogrammes of
dried peel of the Curaçoa of Holland and the zests of
eighty fresh oranges are submitted to the action of sixty
litres of alcohol (85 degrees, French measurement), and
that, save in the colour, there is no real difference
between white Curaçoas and brown. At all events either
is very useful in a cocktail, or swizzle; and there are
many restorative compounds, or “tonics” as they are
called, into which the liqueur enters. <span class="xxpn"
id="p194">{194}</span></p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Cassis</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">owing to the ridiculously-high duty imposed
upon its importation, is comparatively unknown
in England, although it can be obtained at every
little roadside <i>cabaret</i> in France, cheap enough.
The cassis of Dijon has a great reputation as a
cooling drink. There is an infinitesimal portion
of alcohol in it, and it can, I should say, be easily
made at home by anybody who possesses some
nice ripe black-currants. Still the nearest the
ordinary English householder gets to cassis is in
the man­u­fac­ture of so-called “black-currant
tea”; and you only get that when you have a
sore throat.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Chartreuse.</i></h3>

<p>One of the most severe sects of monks man­u­fac­ture
a liqueur which is the highest prized and
priced of all, for the benefit of Sybarites who
deny themselves no luxury in life. St. Bruno
the founder of this order chose for his monastery
the most desolate and barren spot he could find
in the mountains of Dauphiné, and forbade his
followers to eat the flesh of bird or beast; the
fruit of the vine and strong waters being likewise
defended. But one of them discovered, nev­er­the­less,
that a most se­duc­tive liquid could be
distilled from plants, chief amongst them being
Angelica Archangelica—a plant which it is probable
did not receive its holy name until trial had
been made of the distillation. The Carthusian
monks have the sole right of selling this liqueur—a
right which brings them
in a very <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span>
substantial revenue; for Chartreuse is esteemed—in
France, at all events—above all <i>chasses</i>. The
yellow kind is the best, and the white mildest of
the three, of which the green is fiery. Personally,
I prefer curaçoa, or, better still, cognac ’65.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>The name of the “little refreshers” consumed
at tavern-bars in large cities is legion. I have
heard the following compounds called for, at
dif­fer­ent times: sherry-and-bitters—there being
at least half a dozen sorts of bitters—gin-and-ditto,
whisky-and-ditto; vermouth (Italian or
French), vermouth-and-sloe-gin, gin-and-sherry,
gin-and-orange-gin, sloe-gin, gin-and-sloe-gin
(commonly called “slow-and-quick”), curaçoa-and-brandy,
whisky alone, brandy alone, gin
alone. And in the Borough there is a dreadful
mix­ture known by the approp­ri­ate name of</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Twist</i>.</h3>

<p>“This,” says an esteemed cor­re­spon­dent, “is
a favourite liqueur of the porters in the hop-warehouses.
You go into the ‘Red Cross,’ for
instance, and ask for a ‘&#x202f;’alf-quartern o’ Twist in
a three-out glass,’ and you will find that it consists
of equal parts of rum and gin, and is a
powerful pick-me-up after a wet night.”</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>I should question the “pick-me-up” part of
this story; therefore shall not schedule “Twist”
in my list of Restoratives, in the next chapter.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Kirschenwasser.</i></h3>

<p>This is a wholesome and reviving liqueur made from
the cherries which grow in the Black Forest. It is
not as potent as maraschino, which <span class="xxpn"
id="p196">{196}</span> is also made from cherries,
in another place. But the Black Forest cherry-water
requires a little treatment to render it palatable.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Put a little in a saucer; take a lump of sugar, set
fire to it, and replace it in the saucer, so that the
rest of the liquid may be set ablaze. When the
flame is burnt out and the sugar melted, the liqueur
is fit to drink.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Noyeau</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">is made from white brandy and apricot-kernels,
and is the sweetest, as well as the most pernicious
of all liqueurs. I do not know how many glasses
it would take to kill an ordinary man, but most
people know that noyeau contains hydrocyanic
acid of which none but those tired of the world
would care to drink too much.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Parfait Amour</i></h3>

<p>“What’s in a
<span class="sprghta">name&#x202f;?&#x202f;”</span> This is simply bad
orange-bitters, and there is neither love nor
perfection in it. But they say that in dear old
England, in the olden time, before oranges could
be bought at three-halfpence per dozen, it was
customary for a lover, on New Year’s Day, to
present his sweetheart with an orange stuck all
over with cloves, as an emblem of Perfect Love.
The sweetheart of to-day prefers a bangle, or a
bicycle.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>One more liqueur,</p>

<h3><i>Maraschino</i>.</h3>

<p>This is a bitter-sweet liqueur made at Zara
from the kernel of the Marasca
cherry, or gean <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
of Dalmatia. The word implies bitterness, yet
the liquid is sweet enough to catch flies. “It is
a curious fact,” says a modern writer, “in natural
history that the fair sex prefer a sweet liqueur to
the finest wine; and they have such a tendency
to maraschino that Mr. Hayward has proposed
that whereas the toast most honoured among
men is Wine and Women, they should adopt as
their own return toast—Men and Maraschino.”</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>The French make different imitations of the
true liqueur, one of them from peach-stones,
which they call “Marasquin de pêches.” And
in the true Maraschino of Zara there be a few
peach-stones mixed with those of the geans.
These are small and quite black, and are fermented
first with honey, then with the leaves
and kernels of the fruit, and are last of all distilled
and sweetened with sugar.</p>

<p>One more cordial, to finish the chapter. The
recipe was given in the <i>Lady’s Pictorial</i>, by Mrs.
C. E. Humphry, the delightful and ever-welcome
“Madge” of <i>Truth</i>. I can vouch for the
efficacy of the potion.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Ginger Cordial.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Two quarts of Scotch whisky, three lemons sliced,
one ounce of ground ginger, half an ounce of carraway
seeds, three pounds of lump-sugar, one ounce of
bitter almonds, three ounces of sweet almonds, one
pound of raisins. Put all into a crock, and stir every
day for three weeks. Then strain through three
folds of blotting-paper, or one fold of filtering-paper,
and bottle.</p></blockquote></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<span class="hsmall">THE AFTERMATH OF REVELRY</span></h2>

<div class="depigraph">

things — Why will ye do it? — The devil in solution — Alcoholism
a disease — An accountant on wires — A jumpy
journalist — A lot of jolly dogs — What is “Langdebeefe”? — To

to your nerve!</div>

<p class="pfirst">This is a world of compensations.
Therefore it is of no use shut­ting our eyes to the fact
that for every minute of inju­di­cious, over-estimated
revelry, of devotion to the rosy god, passed at night in
the best of society, with boon com­pan­ions, we are liable
to an hour’s dis­tur­bance, worry, agony of mind, head­ache,
remorse of con­science, “jim-jams,” “Kat­zen­jam­mer” (the
equiv­a­lent for “hot coppers”)—call it what you will, next
day. Some suf­fer for over-indulgence more than others.
There be so-called “seasoned casks” who claim that no
amount of debauchery can affect them for the worse, as
long as the <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
liquor be good, and not swal­lowed too quickly. But,
although these may “come up smiling” next day, on making
their first public appearance, the col­lapse, the down­fall
is only post­poned. With­out being able to explain these
things medically, it is certain that Alcohol—which is, as
previously explained, the Devil in Solution—will destroy
in the end, if you abuse her, although her methods of
destruc­tion may dif­fer, according to the capacity, or
con­sti­tu­tion, of her victims.</p>

<p>And let not the over-estimator expect any
sympathy from the world, or any part of it,
whilst he is experiencing the “remorse of
conscience” stage. Katzenjammer patients are
sternly and forcibly refused admission to any
public hospitals, even if <i>in extremis</i>; for mercy,
charity, and the medical faculty have refused
hitherto to recognize the fact that alcoholism is
a disease. And he who is “jumpy” and nervous
of a morning has just as much chance of obtaining
condolence from friends or relatives as has
the casual sufferer from gout. Both disorders
are, in fact, excellent provocatives of badinage
and laughter.</p>

<p>I remember hearing of an accountant in
Cape Town, a hardened and determined “night
bird,” a frequenter of hostelries, a boon companion—in
short, a sot. He was called as a
witness in an intricate case in the High Court,
one morning, whilst suffering terribly from
nerves. It was heart-rending to watch his
agony. His features twitched, his eyes rolled,
and his hands shook as though afflicted with
palsy on the higher scale.
The ledgers which <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
were occasionally handed up to him by the usher,
for reference, slipped from his grasp, and documentary
testimony flew all over the counsels’
wigs. At length the notice of the judge was
attracted to the state of things.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with that witness?”
asked his lordship. “Is he trifling with the
court?”</p>

<p>“M’lord,” said counsel for the plaintiff, “I
am instructed that the witness is what may be
called a free-liver, and that it is often necessary
for him to swallow a dram in the morning, before
proceeding to business. I am also instructed
that the witness overslept himself this morning,
and had no time to procure the necessary dose,
before appearing as a witness before your lordship.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” exclaimed the judge. “This
is wasting the time of the court. Let him be
removed at once to the waiting-room and dosed
with old brandy.”</p>

<p>He was a practical judge; and in five minutes’
time that accountant had pulled himself together.</p>

<p>And an even more painful case than the
above is within my memory. A certain newspaper-proprietor
was in the habit of paying the
weekly wages of his staff himself, each member
having to sign a receipt for the reward of merit.
The fashion-editor—a hardened libertine—turned
up one Saturday, before his chief,
absolutely incapable of signing his name, or any
part of it. His gait was all right, as was his
speech; but the pen slipped through his fingers
as though it had been a
well-oiled icicle. The <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
chief called the next case, the while some of us
poured over-proof rum down the throat of the
fashion-editor at an adjacent hostelry. He
sub­se­quent­ly trousered his salary, and signed the
receipt, sat­is­fac­tor­i­ly, after pleading that he was
suffering that morning from “shock.”</p>

<p>The chief looked somewhat incredulous.</p>

<p>“Is he an inebriate?” he asked, as soon as
the invalid had left the office.</p>

<p>“Oh! dear no, sir,” replied the acrostic-editor,
“he’s almost a teetotaller.”</p>

<p>And the incident was finished.</p>

<p>But what is really the best thing to be done
under such sad circumstances? Should the
invalid resort to the old remedy, and take at
once that “hair of the dog” who bit him overnight?
Not invariably. For instance, should
British port, or brandy of the desiccated-window-sill
(<i>vide</i> a former chapter) have been the <i>causa
teterrima</i> of the trouble, nobody, however shaky,
would revert to such remedies, the first thing
after waking. And frequently it is difficult for
the waker to remember <i>which</i> dog it was that
assaulted him. I once visited a young friend in
his chambers, at the hour of noon, and found
him with a sad countenance, seated in an easy-chair
faced by a perfect army of assorted bottles.
I was about to administer a mild reproof, but he
stopped me.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, dear old chappie, I’ve been
taking a hair of the dog—<i>you</i> know. But I met
such a lot of dogs, jolly dogs too, last night,
that I’m hanged if I can remember which of ’em
bit me!” <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span></p>

<p>The ancients cooled their coppers, for the
most part, with ale, either small or large. And
I am led to the belief that cider, or some preparation
of apples, was also used as a pick-me-up,
if “mel­an­choly vapours”—a complaint for which
Gervase Markham specially rec­om­mend­ed cider
as a specific—meant the same thing as alcoholic
remorse. Search as I may I can find no recipe, no
prescription, in old books for “hot coppers.” Can
it be that the ancients, who as previously pointed
out, were <i>not</i> teetotallers, deceived themselves
in protesting before men that they had no sin?</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Here is an old recipe headed:</p>

<h3>“<i>Against Drunkennesse.</i></h3>

<p>“If you would not be drunke, take the powder
of <i>Betany</i> and <i>Coleworts</i> mix’t together; and eat
it every morning fasting, as much as will lie on
a sixpence, and it will preserve a man from
drunkennesse.”</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>But this is an alleged preventive of the act,
and not a chaser of sorrow from the brow of the
unwise partaker.</p>

<p>“To quicken a man’s wits,” writes the same
Mr. Markham, “spirit and memory, let him
take Langdebeefe”—can this mean <i>langue de
bœuf</i>?—“which is gathered in June or July,
and beating it in a cleane mortar; Let him drinke
the juyce thereof with warme water, and he
shall finde the benefit.”</p>

<p>Probably the most useful part of this prescription
was the warm water; still it can hardly be regarded as a
restorative. <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span></p>

<p>Other recipes are before me, for “drawing
out bones broken in the head,” and “for the
falling of the mould of the head”; but these,
apparently, have no concern with the question
at issue. But to continue the search—<i>eureka!</i></p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3>“<i>To Cure Spleen or Vapours.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take an ounce of the filings of steel, two
drachms of gentian sliced, half an ounce of
carduns seeds bruised, half a handful of centaury
tops; infuse all these in a quart of white wine
four days, and drink four spoonfuls of the clear
every morning, fasting two hours after it, and
walking about.”</p></blockquote>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>This I take to be a <i>bona fide</i> pick-me-up of
two hundred years ago; and if “carduns” be the
old spelling of “cardamom” ’tis very much the
same mixture that the chemist will place in the
trembling hand of the over-estimator, enquiring
at the same time, “Would you like a lozenge
after it, sir?” And the omission of sal volatile
or chloric ether in the prescription leads to the
belief that those drugs were joys unknown to
the reveller of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The most aggravating part about the aftermath
of revelry is that it takes, just as it likes,
directly opposite forms. Two sinners may jump
the same stiff course—by this sporting metaphor
is meant imbibe the same amount and description
of alcohol—after dinner, and, whilst A may wake
with a double-breasted headache, a taste of sewage
in the mouth, and a tongue as foul and furry as
a stoat’s back, B will commence the
day with a <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
dreadful sinking at the base of the stomach, palpitation
of the heart, and a desire to eat anything
solid within reach. A prays faintly for
burnt brandy, or death, and could not swallow
even a devilled biscuit, were you to promise to
make him a director of a gold-mine for performing
that feat; whilst B is “dead off” brandy, but is
capable of washing down ham and eggs and
chops unlimited, with a gallon or two of coffee.
Any medical man will doubtless give a reason
for this discrepancy, which is quite beyond my
powers of elucidation.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>The Best Pick-me-up</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">known to the writer is “the Boy, the whole
Boy, and nothing but the Boy.” ’Tis an expensive
restorative, no doubt; but, just as you cannot
make an omelette without breaking eggs,
so are most of our pleasant vices more or less
costly in the long-run. Champagne, <i>i.e.</i> genuine
champagne, is about the most valuable restorative
known to science, and has—I believe, though
this is not within my own experience—saved the
lives of sufferers from the “black death,” cholera.
Whether blended with beaten eggs, bitters, or
brandy, or in his pure natural beauty, there is,
believe me, no such effectual sorrow-chaser as
“The Boy.”</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Anchovy Toast.</i></h3>

<p>The next best restorer of the faculties is a
quasi-solid; and the recipe for its con­coc­tion has
already been given in <i>Cakes
and Ale</i>. As, <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
how­ever, a portion of the public may be fated to
enjoy the ale with­out the cakes, here it is again.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>First and foremost, bear in mind that this
appetizer must not be made in the kitchen. It
comes under the heading of “parlour cookery,”
and can even be man­u­fac­tured in the bedroom of
the sufferer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A hot-water plate is necessary for the operator,
or, better still, a slop-basin filled with water as near
the boiling point as possible, with a plate placed
atop. Melt on this plate a piece of butter about
the size of a walnut, and when the butter is oiled
stir therein with a fork the beaten yolk of one egg.
Keep on the stir, and add, gradually, a dessert spoonful
of essence of anchovies. Add cayenne, according
to your disposition, or indisposition, and then
you will be ready for a nice strip or two of delicately-browned
toast, brought up hot from the kitchen
fire. Soak the toast in the mixture, and eat as
much as you can.</p></blockquote>

<p>Above is the estimate for <i>one</i> invalid. It is
essentially a pick-me-up for a bachelor—benedicts
never require these things—and if, whilst in
barracks, or chambers, Jack, Tom, and Harry
should call, the proportions of the ingredients
must, of course, be increased. A glass or two
of the Boy will be found to go down excellent
well with this toast, the secret of which I learnt
long years ago, in British India. It is <i>not</i> a
dish for the dinner-table.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>A</p>

<h3><i>Baltimore Egg Nogg</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">reads like a “large order.” It is
said by its <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span>
author to be “an excellent drink for debilitated
people, and a nourishing diet for consumptives.”
And he would be a Good Samaritan, who would
wait outside the big gates of Holloway Castle,
on a Monday morning, in order to administer
the nogg, in full doses, to the starved captives
on their release. It would also, I should imagine,
make an excellent hospital drink, for a score or
so of patients.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>Beat the yolks of sixteen eggs and twelve tablespoonfuls
of pulverized loaf-sugar to the consistency
of cream; stir into this two-thirds of a grated nutmeg,
and then pour in half a pint of good old brandy,
or Jamaica rum—or both <i>n.q.</i>—and three wine-glasses
of Madeira. Have ready the whites of the
sixteen eggs, whipped to a stiff froth, and beat them
well into the above mixture, and then stir in six
pints of new milk, as fresh as possible from the cow.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the best restoratives is that which is
frequently given by the trainer of an athlete, or
boxer, should his charge feel the effects of overwork.
It consists of the heart of a good loin
chop, free from fat, and neither underdone nor
overdone, on a very hot plate, with a glass of
port wine poured over the meat. Another
familiar strengthener is prepared in the following
<span class="nowrap">way:—</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Put a tablespoonful of old brandy into half a
pint of good beef-tea. And by beef-tea I mean the
juices of the meat extracted at home, and not by the
employées of advertising firms. “Breakfast delicacies”
and tinned preparations are only for the
unwary. This may be taken either
hot or cold. <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span></p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Orange Quinine</i></h3>

<p class="pcontinue">is an excellent tonic.</p>
</div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<blockquote>
<p>To a pint bottle of orange wine add ten grains
of sulphate of quinine, cork well, and let it stand
for a few days. Take a wine-glassful at a time,
either with or without a dash of soda-water.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Brandy-and-Soda</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">already alluded to in an earlier chapter, will get
no recommendation from me, as a restorative.
If quite certain of your soda-water, and of your
brandy, a tumblerful on occasion will do no
harm; but do not be in too great a hurry to
order this, after meeting an old friend, in a
strange district. Like Wotsisname’s pills, the
more brandy-and-sodas you take, the more you
will want; and the tendency of soda-water is
distinctly lowering. As for bad soda-water—well,
it will kill almost as rapidly as will bad
brandy.</p></div><!--dkeeptgth-->

<p>A favourite restorative of the working man,
who has been propounding abstruse political
problems in the tap-room all night, is a red-herring,
eaten raw, with the aid of his clasp-knife.
This he will wash down with some sort
of ale, or with a mixture of gin-and-peppermint,
according to the state of his feelings. That old,
heroic soberer the Pump, is not much used for
that purpose, nowadays.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>A Scorcher</i></h3>

<p class="pfirst">Although it is the fashion of the day to belittle,
if not sneer at, the works of “Boz,” he has
still sufficient admirers to justify a chapter on
what is, I hope, a congenial subject to my
readers. The characters may be unduly elaborated,
and the incidents too much spun-out for
these slap-dash, go-ahead times; but it is to the
simple, homely, hospitality so often referred to
in the novels of Charles Dickens that most of
them owed that popularity which
may, or may <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
not, be on the wane. The close student of these
novels will discover that all which is good, and
honest, and upright, and charitable is honoured
in their pages, whilst meanness, deceit, hypocrisy,
and cant are lashed with no uncertain hand.
“The greatest of all gifts is Charity,” is the
lesson taught by Charles Dickens, who shewed
at the same time that it is quite possible to enjoy
the good things of life without making a beast
of oneself. And he it was who clothed Christmas
in that warm, sumptuous robe of joviality and
hospitality which makes all who keep that festival
in the proper spirit forget for the time that a
quarter’s rent falls due on the same day.</p>

<p>Dickens’s drunkards are few and far between—and
in this category I do not include such as
Sydney Carton, the members of the Pickwick
Club, and David Copperfield, on the occasion
of his first dinner-party. Nobody has a right to
call the man who makes merry with his friends,
now and then, a sot; and a careful study of
Dickens shows that the real inebriates, the
“habituals” described in his works, had all more
or less rascality in their composition—not even
excepting Dick Swiveller, who, however, became
a reformed character towards the close of the
book.</p>

<p>As for the drinks themselves, it is especially
worthy of note that there is no mention whatever
made of whisky in these works; a fact which
justifies everything which I have written in a
former chapter as to the neglect with which this
undoubtedly estimable and wholesome fortifier
was treated by society, until within
the last few <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
decades. A brandy-and-soda was an unknown
fact during the Dickens period; simply because,
although there was plenty of brandy, the true
virtues of soda-water had not been discovered.
Moreover, nobody was known to call for a gin-and-bitters,
or a sherry-and-angostura; whilst
cocktails and cobblers are mentioned only in
the American chapters of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.
Ales and beers were known by various fantastic
names during the first half of the present century,
when men knew not “four-’alf” nor “bitter-six”;
thus we have little David Copperfield
gravely asking for a glass of the “Genuine
Stunning,” whilst Mrs. Gamp was unable to
fulfil her arduous duties sat­is­fac­tor­i­ly without a
generous allowance of “the Brighton old
Tipper.”</p>

<p>But to the books themselves. And commencing
with <i>David Copperfield</i>—who is provided
with the heart, feelings, and understanding of
the great novelist himself—I make my first
pause at the waiter at the Yarmouth hotel. I
don’t like that waiter, either as a man or a
waiter; and his portrait by “Phiz” suggests a
Cheap Jack at a fair, or a barber, rather than a
coffee-room attendant. As a boy, I always
looked up to a waiter as a benefactor—a species
of Santa Claus, and not as a marauding varlet
who would probably despoil me of my lawful
share of the banquet and then lie about the
incident to the landlady. And when this rascal
pleads that he “lives on broken wittles, and
sleeps on the coals,” I lose patience with him.
A waiter who could rob a poor boy
of his beer <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
would not need to sleep on the coals. He might
have been a tax-gatherer, or a bailiff.</p>

<p>Mr. Creakle, the schoolmaster, appears to
have been a bit of an imbiber, whilst the boys
themselves partook, <i>sub rosa</i>, of cowslip wine,
occasionally fortified by Steerforth with orange
juice, ginger, or a peppermint drop; and it was
probably due to this decoction, rather than to
“Crab,” that poor Traddles became ill in the
night—his sufferings being unduly prolonged by
black draughts and blue pills, not to mention
six chapters of Greek Testament and a special-extra
caning. Poor little David partook of
assorted drinks during his boyhood, including
the aforesaid “Genuine Stunning,” and occasional
wine-glasses of punch whilst lodging with
the Micawber family; and, his good aunt once
found, “her first proceeding was to unlock a
tall press, bring out several bottles, and pour
some of the contents of each into my mouth.
I think they must have been taken out at random,
for I am sure I tasted aniseed water, anchovy
sauce, and salad dressing.”</p>

<p>“My aunt” partook of hot white wine and
water, with strips of toast soaked therein, by
way of a night-cap; and whenever Micawber
turns up, we may be sure that the ingredients
for a bowl of punch (presumably rum punch) are
not far off. Not much drinking was done in
the Peggotty family, but Mrs. Crupp, David’s
landlady, seems to have had the proverbial passion
of her race for brandy; and, naturally enough,
the “handy young man” hired to wait, on the
occasion of the dinner to
Steerforth, got more <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
than his fair share of the wines. Mr. Wickfield—silly
old dotard to be deceived by such a
shallow, transparent ruffian as Uriah Heep—drank
assorted wines to drown his cares; whilst
one of the servants engaged by Dora, during
her brief experience of matrimonial joys, used
to chalk up an account, in her mistress’ name,
at the public house, the items appearing as
“half-quartern gin and cloves (Mrs. C.);” “glass
rum and peppermint (Mrs. C.)”—the parenthesis
always referring to Dora, who was supposed to
have consumed the whole of these refreshments.</p>

<p>There is a fair amount of assorted drinking in
<i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>. Revelry at Pecksniff Hall
took, we learn, the form of red and white currant
wine, of acid char­ac­ter­is­tics, the remains of the
two bottles being sub­se­quent­ly blended, for the
special malefit of Tom Pinch and young Martin.
But the artful Pecksniff himself did not stir
without the brandy bottle when going on a
journey, and the family seem to have done themselves
particularly well at “Todgers’s.” Whenever
I feel more than ordinarily depressed in
spirits, I overhaul my <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> and
read, once again, the report of the dinner at
Todgers’s, which led to Mr. Pecksniff’s fall into
the fireplace. John Westlock—about the most
admirable young man in all Dickens’s novels—did
not forget to do his friends well at Salisbury.
“As to wines,” we are told, “the man who can
dream such iced champagne, such claret, port, or
sherry, had better go to bed and stop there.”</p>

<p>The blackmailing of the captain of the <i>Screw</i>
by the proprietor of the <i>New
York Rowdy Journal</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span>
took the form of champagne; and the merits of
a sherry cobbler are fully recognized by Martin,
who sub­se­quent­ly, however, fared badly in the
way of wines and spirits whilst in the States.
Eden, that alleged “prosperous city,” appears to
have possessed neither pawn-shop, place of
worship, nor drinking-bar; and the comparative
delights of the “Dragon” on the return of Mark
and Martin to Wiltshire are made delightfully
apparent. As for the bad characters, Chevy
Slyme loafed in a chronic state of eleemosynary
drink, until he joined the police force, whilst
Montague Tigg fared sumptuously on the best
of liquor—including old Maderia—until knocked
on the head by the villain Jonas, who also appears
to have been a bit of a soaker, when he could
get his drink for nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gamp’s wants were few and simple, but
she insisted upon a regular supply, and got it.
Leaving solid sustenance out, she stipulated for
“a pint of mild porter at lunch, a pint at dinner,
half a pint as a species of stay or holdfast between
dinner and tea, and a pint of the celebrated
staggering ale, or Real Old Brighton Tipper, at
supper; besides the bottle on the chimney-piece,
and such casual invitations to refresh herself with
wine as the good breeding of her employers
might prompt them to offer.” And she never
exceeded the allowance of a shillingsworth of
gin-and-water warm when she rang the bell a
second time after supper. She must have cost
as much to keep as a steam-yacht. The contents
of Mrs. G.’s teapot, on the occasion of her
historic quarrel with Betsy Prig,
are alluded to, <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span>
vaguely, by the novelist as “spirits,” and were,
I shall ever maintain, gin, and <i>not</i> rum, as stated
by other reviewers. The idea of putting rum
on the top of “Newcastle salmon, intensely
pickled,” and such a monstrous (to a <i>connoisseur</i>
in these things) salad as that furnished by Mrs.
Prig, is barbaric.</p>

<p>After an experience of the modern roadside
inn, or of the “reserved lounges” of the alcohol-palaces
of to-day, what can be more delightful
reading than the description of the interior of
the “Maypole,” in <i>Barnaby Rudge</i>?</p>

<p>“The very snuggest, cosiest, and completest
bar that ever the wit of man devised. Such
amazing bottles in old oaken pigeon-holes; such
gleaming tankards hanging from pegs at about
the same inclination as thirsty men would hold
them to their lips; such sturdy little Dutch kegs
ranged in rows on shelves; so many lemons
hanging in separate nets, suggestive, with goodly
loaves of sugar stowed away hard by, of punch,
idealized beyond all mortal knowledge, etc. etc.”</p>

<p>Hardly an ideal landlord of the past, though,
was old John Willet. A far better stamp of
host was Gabriel Varden, the locksmith, who took
deep draughts of sparkling home-brewed ale, from
a goodly jug of well-browned clay, for breakfast,
and who was one of the “Maypole’s” best customers.
Mr. Chester—whose interview with his
son will remind the student of Monsieur le Marquis’s
interview with his nephew, in <i>A Tale of
Two Cities</i>—was a judge of wine, though not
given to over-indulgence in the bowl, like his
bastard, Maypole Hugh;
and Lord George <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
Gordon’s favourite brew appears to have been
hot mulled wine. As for the rest of the rioters,
they drank, after the manner of rioters, anything
they could get.</p>

<p>The first mention of wine in <i>A Tale of Two
Cities</i> is the fall and breakage, <i>pro bono publico</i>, of
a large cask of inferior claret in the district of
St. Antoine—emblematic of the blood to be spilt
in Paris later on—which called forth the delightful,
philosophic remark of Defarge, the master
of the wine-shop to which the cask had been
consigned: “It is not my affair. The people
from the market did it. Let them bring another.”
But the chief imbibers in the book are Sydney
Carton and Serjeant Stryver, the pushing and
successful advocate for whom the other “devilled.”
Stryver, we gather from Edmund Yates’s <i>Reminiscences</i>,
was modelled by Dickens, from Mr.
Edwin James, Q.C., who at one time “stood
high in popular favour,” and who “liked talking.”
There is plenty of sub­se­quent moderate drinking—in
Defarge’s wine-shop principally—but with
the exception of these two advocates, Stryver and
Carton—“what the two drank together, between
Hilary Term and Michaelmas might have floated
a king’s ship”—nobody appears to swallow an
undue amount of alcohol, in this the most powerful,
and the saddest, of all Dickens’s books.</p>

<p>I could never wade through <i>Our Mutual
Friend</i>, and <i>Little Dorrit</i> is not one of my
favourite books. It was ruthlessly mauled by
the <i>Saturday Review</i> soon after its appearance,
and Thackeray’s openly expressed opinion of the
work was “<i>Little D.</i> is Deed
stupid.” I have <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
heard another great man express the same opinion
of it, in more elegant language. There is not
much revelry in <i>Little D.</i> until we get to the
second volume; and with the exception of
Blandois the strangler and the romantic Flora
nobody appears to have a really good thirst. In
the Marshalsea the “collegians” were evidently
worse provided with alcoholic comfort than in
the Fleet; and this is all which can be written
in this chapter about <i>Little Dorrit</i>.</p>

<p><i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, on the other hand, is full of
allusions to the flowing bowl. Most of the
characters—Smike being a notable exception—moisten
their clay in some way or other, from
dear old Crummles, who is introduced to our
notice with a rummer of hot brandy-and-water
in one hand, to the ruffian Squeers. Newman
Noggs owed his fall in life to the bold, bad,
bottle, and Mantalini presumably took to gin
together with the washer-woman, in his declining
years. The Brothers Cheeryble were evidently
the right sort of people to dine with—although
their dinner-hour would hardly suit the present
generation—especially if they had many magnums
of that famed “Double Diamond.” Sir Mulberry
Hawk and his lordly victim drank deep, after the
fashion of the day; whilst the keeper of the
“rooge-a-nore from Paris” booth on Hampton
race-course stimulates the energies of his patrons
with excellent champagne, port, sherry, and
(most likely) British brandy. Old Gride keeps
a bottle of “golden water”—presumably the
Dantzic liqueur, “Acqua d’Oro,” mentioned in
my chapter on that form of
fluid—in his cupboard, <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
and doles out on one occasion a minute glass
thereof to Newman Noggs, who would evidently,
like the farmer at the audit dinner, prefer it “in
a moog.” Mr. Lillyvick, the collector of water-rates,
was especially partial to punch—which was
“cut off” so unexpectedly for the benefit of
Nicholas, after his walk from Yorkshire to the
metropolis; and the whole of Mr. Crummles’s
company, ladies included, liked a taste of the
same beverage. Finally, John Browdie, the
good genius of the book, was a fellow of infinite
swallow, always ready for his meals, and never
behindhand when there was a full jug or bottle
handy. And it is recorded that upon being
knocked up by Nicholas, on the visit of the
last-named to Yorkshire, with the news of
Squeers’s trial and sentence, “forced him down
upon a huge settle beside a blazing fire, poured
out from an enormous bottle about a quarter of
a pint of spirits, thrust it into his hand, opened
his mouth, and threw back his head as a sign to
him to drink it.” And before breakfast, too!</p>

<p>Bill Sikes, on occasion, drank brandy “at a
furious rate”; but more often poverty prevented
his slaking his thirst on anything more deadly
than Spitalfields ale, or eleemosynary gin. The
whole of Mr. Fagin’s pupils drank whenever
opportunity offered, either malt liquor or gin-and-water
out of pewter pots; but the Jew himself,
with the innate caution of his race, avoided the
wiles of the bowl. Nancy was an “habitual,”
in her youth, most probably, or she would not
have chummed up with such a criminal crew;
and as for Monks, the disorder
known as <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span> <i>delirium
tremens</i> was no stranger to him. Bumble and
his wife were not averse to a social glass; and
even the charity-boy, Noah Claypole, indulged,
during the absence of his master, the undertaker,
in oysters, porter, and some sort of wine, name
not mentioned. As far as we are told, the decent
members of society in <i>Oliver Twist</i> were very
moderate in their potations; although it is in my
mind that Mr. Fang, the stipendiary, was a
port-wine man.</p>

<p>In <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> we get allusions to
liquids of all kinds, from orange-peel and water,
the favourite beverage of the Marchioness, to the
truly-awful “wanities” of Quilp, which took the
form of over-proof rum, boiled, burnt brandy, or
raw Schiedam out of a keg. Quilp, by the way,
if amusing enough, is the most exaggerated
character ever invented by the great novelist, and
has no business out of the realms of pantomime.
But he was very, very funny, as impersonated by
“Johnny” Clarke in the long ago. Dick
Swiveller was a swindler by profession, although
like many of these a boon companion, speechifier,
and framer of jovial sentiments. The “rosy
wine” was represented at his humble home by
geneva-and-water, and his astonishment when
Mr. Brass’ lodger made a brew of “extra­or­di­nary”
rum-and-water in “a kind of temple, shining as
of polished silver,” at the same time cooking a
steak, an egg, and a cup of coffee, in the same
temple, can only have been exceeded by his joy
at getting something really decent to drink.</p>

<p>The strolling performers with whom Nell
and Grandfather
travelled did themselves <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span>
particularly well, especially dear old Mrs. Jarley,
whose consideration for her own comforts was
fully equalled by her desire for the worldly welfare
of others.</p>

<p>In <i>Bleak House</i> allusions to the bowl are
infrequent. The rag-shop “Lord Chancellor”
cremated himself with the aid of gin, and Mr.
Tul­king­horn had a weak­ness for old port. Mr.
Bucket favoured brown sherry, and Harold
Skimpole would nibble a peach and sip claret, with
an execution in his house. This is one of the
best characters drawn by Dickens; and although
the type is not a familiar one, I have met him in
the flesh.</p>

<p><i>Dombey and Son</i> is by no means a “thirsty”
work; though Joey Bagstock was a votary of
the bowl, like old Mrs. Brown. The rest of the
company put together (I except “the Chicken”)
would not have enabled a publican to pay his
rent, and one of the most mel­an­choly parts of the
book is the mention made therein of only one
bottle of the old Madeira remaining in the cellar
of Sol Gills, at a time when most of the other
characters in the book—male and female—are
making use of his house.</p>

<p>Next to my <i>Pickwick</i> I love my <i>Great Expectations</i>.
Brandy-and-tar-water, imbibed by
Pumblechook, in mistake, at the Christmas
dinner, should properly come under the heading
of “Strange Swallows”; but the capacity of
those two bottles of port and sherry, which he
brought as a present on that occasion, has always
been a puzzle to me. Joe, probably, would not
be allowed more than a
glass, and, naturally, <span class="xxpn" id="p223">{223}</span>
little Pip would be out of it; but there remained
Wopsle, Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and Pumblechook
himself; whilst afterwards the sergeant joined
in the treat, and had two glasses. And all these
people were served from one bottle; for we are
distinctly told that the second cork was not
drawn until the first bottle had been emptied.</p>

<p>Miss Havisham’s relations having been brewers,
beer was naturally the refreshment offered to
little Pip, whilst in service there, although there
seems to have been a bottle or two of wine in
the cellars, for the benefit of Mr. Jaggers and
others. That worthy, like most successful
lawyers of the present day, was a light luncher—a
sandwich, and the contents of a flask of sherry
serving him for the purpose; but we are told
that at his dinners both meat and drink were
unexceptionable. His great hand always savoured
of scented soap, and at luncheon the odour of
superior sherry pervaded his office.</p>

<p>The convict’s emissary, himself a released
felon, stirred his rum-and-water with a file; and
this appears to have been the favoured drink of
the “returned transport,” Magwitch. There
was a large consumption of port and sherry—chiefly
by Pumblechook—after the remains of
Mrs. Gargery had been consigned to the earth;
and what with frequent visits, on the part of the
inhabitants of those parts, to “The Jolly Bargemen”
and “The Boar,” the landlords of those
establishments must have done a thriving trade
indeed.</p>

<p>I wonder if Sir Wilfrid Lawson, or any other
eminent abstainer, ever picked up
a volume of <span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span>
the <i>Pickwick Papers</i> for the purpose of perusal?
If so, and it was an illustrated edition, the frontispiece
must have made his heart quail; for it
represents Pickwick himself standing on a chair
addressing a more or less excited audience, all
seated at a long table, and each with a cigar or
pipe in his mouth, and a large tumbler in front
of him. And if the eminent abstainer cared to
carry his researches farther, he would discover
that ere the Pickwickian deputation had started
on their first journey they had taken part in a
street fight, eventually quelled by the arrival of
a perfect stranger, who celebrates the occasion
by calling for glasses round of brandy-and-water,
hot and strong!</p>

<p>The <i>Pickwick Paper</i> absolutely reek with
alcohol, from title-page to name and address of
printer. Everybody drinks with everybody else,
both in and out of the Fleet Prison. The hospitality
of the good people is unbounded, and good and
bad alike do it full justice. The very instant
the belated travellers have crossed the threshold
of Dingley Dell they are fed with cherry brandy.
The entire deputation has “Katzenjammer,”
on the morning after their arrival at Rochester,
and a duel, or an attempted one, is the consequence.
In coffee-room, bar-parlour, or smoking-room,
an introduction, a story, or a song is an excuse
for a bowl of punch. Wherever the Pickwickians
go they carry trouble, more or less amusing to
the reader, and the trouble is invariably followed
by revelry.</p>

<p>That two medical students should wash down
their oysters with
neat brandy—and before <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span>
breakfast—seems at the first glance an impos­si­bil­ity;
but many of those who know for certain
the effects of undue indul­gence are the most
careless in indulging, and Bob Sawyer and his
still more rascally friend and fellow-student Ben
Allen are reckless types of a reckless profession.
The same meal—oysters <i>cum</i> brandy—is partaken
of, later on, by Solomon Pell and the coachman;
and Dickens probably knew that lawyers and
stage-drivers, like sailors, can digest anything.</p>

<p>The most drunken man in the book, “the
Shepherd,” is an alleged tee­totaller; and the
ab­stain­ing divi­sion will as­suredly never forgive
Dickens for his word-painting of Stiggins, whose
“vanity” was pine-apple rum with hot water
and plenty of sugar. The Wellers, <i>père et fils</i>,
were not con­ser­va­tive in their po­ta­tions; and
whether “the inwariable” is Wellerese for brandy
hot, or rum hot, I am still uncertain, although
many cor­re­spon­dents have sought to enlighten
me on the subject; said cor­re­spon­dents being anything
but unanimous. One of the most favoured
beverages men­tioned in the work is “cold
punch,” by which I under­stand milk-punch, a
very “more-ish” draught indeed.</p>

<p>I have prolonged this chapter perhaps unduly.
But the subject of the Drinks of Dickens is too
important a one to slur over. The man who
cannot appreciate <i>Pickwick</i> has never yet come
my way. There is a peculiar charm about the
book, a broad hospitality, an unbounded love of
the good things of this life which must endear it
to the hearts of true sons of Britannia, who will
revel, on occasion, no matter
what obstacles may <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
be placed in their way. And this is the method
of procedure, the potation being occasionally
varied, which succeeded all the troubles of the
<span class="nowrap">friends:—</span></p>

<p>“So to keep up their good humour they
stopped at the first roadside tavern they came to”—this
was after the punch and pound incident—“and
ordered a glass of brandy-and-water all
round, with a magnum of extra strength for Mr.
Samuel Weller.”</p></div><!--section-->

<p class="pfirst">The
first temperance society in England was
formed at Brad­ford, York­shire, on the 2nd
Feb­ru­ary 1830, the chief mover having been
Mr. Henry Forbes, who had signed the pledge
at Glasgow. But the use of ardent spirits was
condemned by many medical practitioners early
in the seven­teenth cen­tury, although the United
Kingdom does not seem to have abstained from
strong waters any the more. Repressive leg­is­la­tion,
in order to inculcate sobriety, was tried in
Mas­sa­chu­setts, U.S., early in the present century,
but a few years before a society had been formed
at Moreau, New York State, in order to prohibit
the con­sumption of both wines
and spirits, except <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
medicinally, or wine except at public dinners or
in the Lord’s Supper.</p>

<p>The work whence I have gleaned the above
details also informs the reader that “such as
Doctor Samuel Johnson and John Howard set
an example of abstinence from all inebriating
drinks”; which, as far as Doctor Johnson is
concerned, is somewhat startling news to myself.
I had always imagined that the burly lexicographer—I
was reproved by a critic for calling
him this in <i>Cakes and Ale</i>—was a bit of a boon
companion; and the records of Fleet Street
taverns by no means tend to contradict this idea.
Not only is the hard, oaken seat at one end of
the dining-room of “Ye Olde Cheshyre Cheese”
marked with a brass plate, with a suitable inscription,
but the many visitors to that snug hostelry,
including hundreds of our American cousins, are
always taken upstairs and shewn Doctor Johnson’s
chair. Did “Sam,” and “Davy,” and “Noll”
slake their thirst on cold water, beneath that
tavern’s roof? I trow not. Cross out Doctor
Johnson’s name as a total abstainer, please.</p>

<p>In 1834, Mr. J. S. Buckingham, who was
returned for Sheffield to the first Reform Parliament,
succeeded in obtaining a select committee
of the House of Commons, to enquire into the
causes, extent, and remedies of drunkenness. In
the meantime the limitation of the pledge to
abstention from ardent spirits had proved a
greater drawback than in other countries, because
beer had been the popular beverage, and its use
a cause of widespread drunkenness before ardent
spirits were commonly sold. But
the idea of <span class="xxpn" id="p229">{229}</span>
our legislators before 1834 had been that “good
malt and hops could injure nobody.”</p>

<p>From ’34 to ’45 there was great activity in
the temperance ranks through­out the world;
and in ’53 the United Kingdom Alliance for
the Legislative Suppression of the Liquor Traffic
was formed, its first pres­i­dent being Sir W. C.
Trevelyan. In March ’64 a Permis­sive Prohi­bi­tory
Bill was brought into the House of
Commons, but although repeatedly re-introduced
it never obtained a second reading. Nor is it
likely that such a Bill will ever become law as
long as the sons of Britannia are living outside
a state of slavery. Repressive legislation serves
only to stimulate that which it claims to check;
and thus it is that these would-be reformers,
whether Prohibitors of the Drink Traffic,
Vigilance and Purity Societies, and Anti-gambling
Societies have succeeded in making the
state of London infinitely worse, as regards
drunkenness, chastity, and betting, than it was
forty years ago.</p>

<p>Poor frail humanity will always do the thing
which it ought not to do in preference to fulfilling
its obligations. It has been so since the
be­gin­ning of the world, and will continue so
until the end. For­bid­den fruit has ever been the
sweetest; and it is char­ac­ter­is­tic of mankind—and
more especially of womankind—to oppose, as
far as they can, any attempt at restraint. What
has been the effect of closing Cremorne Gardens,
the Argyll Rooms, and other public resorts
where dancing and revelry were carried on until
the small hours,
five-and-twenty years ago? <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
The evil took refuge in the open streets, and,
more recently, in so-called social clubs, in which
illicit liquors were, and are, sold, and the pander,
and the pimp, and the bully met, and meet the
drunkard, the dupe, and the greenhorn. What
has been the effect of the Anti-gambling Crusade?
To create working-men bookmakers.
This is a fact. In most large warehouses and
factories there are <i>employés</i> who will lay “starting
prices,” in shillings and sixpences, to their mates.
There is not a tithe of the amount wagered
amongst the upper classes that there was in the
fifties and sixties; but amongst the horny-handed
sons of toil the vice has increased to an enormous
extent, mainly owing to repressive legislation.
If a man wants to gamble there is only one
factor to prevent him—impecuniosity; and even
that factor need not prevent a man from having
a drink if he waits in the tap-room long enough
on pay-day. Since Sunday closing in Wales,
shebeens have arisen by the hundred; and
paraffin, for want of a better drink, is still drunk
on the Sabbath day, by the miners in the
Rhondda Valley.</p>

<p>All honour to him who abstains from strong
drink for conscience’ sake, or in the hope that
others may profit by his example. But the lash
of scorn for him who because he does not
swallow fermented refreshment himself, says to
his brother “Thou shalt not drink!” The
Puritans abolished bear-baiting, not on account of
the cruelty to the bears, but because the alleged
sport gave pleasure to the people; and the
Puritans of the day, who forbid
cakes and ale, <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
and hunting, and horse-racing, do so for the self-same
reason.</p>

<p>“He who does not smoke,” said the sage,
“has known no great sorrow.” Similarly, it
may be urged that he who never joins in a
friendly glass has known no great joy. Do we
express our unfeigned joy and thankfulness for
having a great and good Queen to reign over us
by toasting her in flat soda-water? Forbid the
deed! When our sons return from the midst of
many and great dangers, from the battle-field,
the raging deep, or the land of savages, do we
express our delight by putting the kettle on to
<span class="sprghta">boil?</span>
<span class="sprghta">Avaunt&#x202f;!</span>
I have known a man who had
won £27,000 on a certain Wednesday at Ascot,
dine that same night off a chump chop, chips,
and a bottle of ginger-beer, at a coffee-house no
great distance from Fleet Street. And he gave
the waitress one penny for herself, and counselled
her not to “get gamblin’&#x202f;” with it. But
amongst my own personal friends, when the
fancied horse catches the eye of the judge, there
is revelry; and who shall say that they sin thereby?
I do not believe in the man who takes his
winnings sadly—or at all events impassively. “A
shout, and a drink, and then sit down and write
about it,” is the programme pursued by a journalistic
friend; and although I do not always “write
about it,” ’tis much the same programme pursued
by myself. Nor do we rejoice for the sole reason
that we have got the better of somebody else.
For, alas! the balance at the end of the year is far
too often in favour of that “somebody else.”</p>

<p>“On the question of the
prohibition of the <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
liquor traffic,” says an authority on the ethics or
total abstinence, “there has been much controversy.
Its opponents have contended that it
is an invasion of personal liberty; that even when
imposed by a majority it is a violation of the
rights of the minority, and that all that is really
required is such a magisterial and police supervision
as will repress drunkenness as much as
possible, and inflict different penalties on
offenders. To this statement various answers
are returned. With regard to the violation of
personal liberty the prohibitionists maintain that
in one sense all law interferes with liberty. A
good law interferes with the liberty to do wrong.
Therefore, they say, assuming that the common
sale of drinks wrongs the public a law interfering
with this wrong is in accord with true liberty.
They hold that individual profit must be subservient
to the public welfare, <i>Salus populi suprema
lex</i>. If hardship is alleged as affecting the buyer,
the statement of John Stuart Mill is quoted,
who declared that every artificial augmentation
of the price of an article is prohibition to the
more or less poor; yet there is hardly any
government which does not in some way or
other legislate so that the price of intoxicants is
increased. As to the possibility of extirpating
intemperance by means of strict regulation as to
the sale of drink, the prohibitionists affirm that
the existing system has been tried for hundreds
of years, and often under the most favourable
circumstances for its success, and that yet the
licensing system, as judged by its fruits, is
confessed to be
a mel­an­choly failure.” <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span></p>

<p>My remarks on the above are few and simple.
It is this very Jesuitical logic which has earned
the “prohibitionists” the contempt of all friends
of freedom. It is this false and tyrannical doctrine
which asserts that “the end justifies the
means,” which still stinks in the nostrils of the
majority of the people’s representatives in
Parliament.</p>

<p>Now for a few hints as to some non-alcoholic
beverages. And first of all let it be stated that
the thirsty man can do much worse than turn to
a teetotal beverage—as long as he avoids the
bottled flatulence which is sold, and freely advertised
outside, in pretty nearly every country
cottage which can boast of good accommodation
for travellers, and a bicycle shed. The iced
fruit-fizzers of Mr. Sainsbury—where the pick-me-ups
come from—close to the <i>Lady’s Pictorial</i>
office, are, to my personal knowledge, freely
patronized in summer-time by habitual worshippers
at the shrine of Bacchus. Moreover a follower
of the sport of kings would rather go without
whisky all the afternoon than miss his cup of
tea, after business hours. No directions are
needed here for the man­u­fac­ture of tea or coffee.
Every housewife has a way of her own; and it
is as the laws of the Medes and Persians that her
way is the only way. Nor need a discussion be
entered on as to the respective merits of different
brands of cocoa.</p>

<h3><i>A Superior Lemon Squash.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take the juice of eight lemons, and sweeten it,
allowing one tablespoonful of sifted
sugar to each <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
lemon. Put the juice into an enamelled saucepan
and simmer gently over the fire until the sugar is
quite dissolved. Beat up the white of one egg, add
to the syrup, and stir well till the mixture boils; let
it boil for a minute or two, and pour gently through
a jelly-bag into a basin. When quite cold add a
quarter of an ounce of citric acid, bottle, and cork
tightly. When required for use, put six drops of
Angostura bitters in a soda-water tumbler, turn it
round and round, then add a wine-glassful of the
squash, fill up with soda-water, place a thin slice of
lemon atop, and serve with two straws.</p></blockquote>

<h3><i>Almond Comfy.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Put six ounces of pulverized sweet almonds and
two ounces of smashed bitters ditto into a saucepan
with one quart of water, and let it simmer for a
quarter of an hour; then add one pound of sifted
sugar. When dissolved strain through a hair sieve or
jelly-bag, and add a tablespoonful of orange-flower
water. When cold, a wine-glassful of the mixture
should be put into a tumbler, which should be filled
up with soda-or Seltzer-water.</p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Temperance Cider.</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Put half a gallon of water on to boil, and when
boiling throw into the saucepan a dozen medium-sized
apples, cut into slices unpeeled. Keep the
lot boiling until quite tender, then strain till dry,
taking care not to let any of the pulp escape through
the sieve. Add sifted sugar <i>ad lib.</i>, and the juice of
two lemons. Let the mixture stand until cool,
when it will be ready for use. Of course ice is an
improvement, in warm weather. And only add a
<i>soupçon</i> of <i>eau de vie</i> when you
are quite alone. <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span></p></blockquote>

<h3><i>Drink for Dog Days</i>,</h3>

<p class="pcontinue">but as this is not a nice name, and suggests

<p>The composition is very simple. Put a
lemon-ice in a large tumbler, fill up with soda-water,
stir well, and drink.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>—Mr. George Krehl, of “Verrey’s,”
who knows something about dog days, and dogs,
won the prize offered in the <i>Sporting Times</i> for
the best recipe for a summer drink, many years

a small glass of Curaçoa, and (I think) a drop or
two of Angostura bitters.</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<h3><i>Cherry Cobbler</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Take one pound of cherries of Kent, free from
stalks and stones. Throw them into a pint of
boiling syrup, made of one pound of loaf-sugar
dissolved in one pint of water. Let the cherries
boil as fast as possible—“gallop” is, I believe, the
technical word—for ten minutes, and then add a
quart of boiling water; put the whole into a pan,
and when cold strain. The addition of soda-water
will make it all the more watery.</p></blockquote>

from stalks; mash them well together, and then add
two quarts of boiling water, and three quarters of a

put into a lined preserving pan, and let the mixture

“Temperance Drinks,” <span class="nowrap">that:—</span></p>

<p>“Many of the British wines, mixed with an
equal quantity of water, with a little ice, make
very cool and refreshing drinks.” Very, very
likely. But can there be wine without fermentation?
And are the total abstainers, not content

ginger-beer, getting the wedge in still further.

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have been
generally retained, with some exceptions noted below.</p>

<p class="pfirst">The index was originally structured rather inconsistently as a nested
list, with line-breaks separating list items. In these ebook editions,
semicolons have been inserted between list items, with full stop
inserted at the end of each top-level entry. The original book
separated key terms from page references with comma, and key
terms from "<i>see</i> [other topic]" with semicolon; the latter
have been changed to comma. One particularly complicated top-level
heading, “Egg”, has been split into three top-level entries, “Egg
flip”, “Egg nogg”, and “Egg punch”.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
